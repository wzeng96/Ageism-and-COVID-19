USC is left lamenting the coach who got away; Trojans paying price for passing on Orgeron in 2013,"Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitEd Orgeron has become the gravelly voice of college football, the passionate face of its championship tournament, the most beloved sideline presence in the country.
Six years ago, USC decided he didn't fit its image.
Orgeron has passionately and tearfully led Louisiana State to the top of the rankings, guided quarterback Joe Burrow to a Heisman Trophy and been named Home Depot college coach of the year.

Six years ago, he holed up in Room 112 of the campus Radisson Hotel and wept after USC told him he wasn't Trojans head coaching material.
""My heart and soul were so empty, it was like being a father who is told you can't have your children anymore,"" Orgeron said afterward.
Today, it is the USC football program that feels so empty, watching Orgeron flex from afar while the Trojans are stuck with a massively unpopular head coach, a disappointing recruiting class and an increasing number of empty Coliseum seats.
The hardest thing for Trojans fans this winter is not only watching Clay Helton march USC into a blah Holiday Bowl but also witnessing Orgeron shoulder LSU toward a national championship.
After all, Orgeron would be the USC head coach today but for three beliefs that seem bonkers.
Because of his giant lineman frame and emotional sideline demeanor, USC thought he didn't have the sophisticated appearance of a Trojans head coach.
Because of his deep and sometime unintelligible Cajun voice, USC thought he didn't sound like a Trojans head coach.
After his loss to a more talented UCLA team in only his eighth game as interim coach in 2013, USC was convinced he didn't command the focus and discipline required of a Trojans head coach.
The school didn't think he could connect with boosters. It didn't think he could work the country clubs. And, even though USC never gave him his own coaching staff, it didn't think he could run a team.
Looking back, it all seems so crazy, and it all could have been so much different, if only then-athletic director Pat Haden had possessed the vision to see beyond the trademark Orgeron sweat.
Orgeron took the program on a wild ride that could have changed everything, yet, because of old-school Trojans stereotypes, it changed nothing.
As USC fans stew over the failing state of their program, it's perhaps worth revisiting the abbreviated Orgeron era to remind them of one of the many ways the Trojans got into this mess.
Orgeron was an assistant who became head coach in late September of that 2013 season after Lane Kiffin was famously fired on an airport tarmac.
Orgeron led the Trojans to a 6-2 record in eight of the most emotionally charged games since the Pete Carroll era.
Then, two days after losing to UCLA in the season finale, he was told the Trojans were hiring Steve Sarkisian as the permanent head coach, a move that upset Orgeron so much he immediately resigned and flew home to Louisiana.
When introducing Sarkisian, a former Trojans assistant, Haden said: ""He knows how to build a program and create a culture that we value. He understands the heritage and tradition of USC.""
Judging from those eight games, he could and should have been saying the same thing about Orgeron.
After one victory, ""Coach O""-inspired players tried to carry him off the field. After another win, seemingly the entire Trojans nation nearly swept him off the field.
He bellowed, he hugged, he opened practices to the world, he reinstated desserts on the training table, he won one game with several backups and walk-ons. He was the epitome of the Trojans family.
Yet he never looked smooth, never sounded executive, he was the anti-Haden, the anti-Sark, and thus became an ex-Trojan. That, and he lost not only to UCLA but also to Notre Dame, and some folks think you cannot hire an interim coach who loses to both in the same year.
I was regrettably one of those people, enchanted by Orgeron's effect but stuck on those two losses. I was supportive of Orgeron. I dutifully chronicled his magic, never agreed with the assessments about his aura, and never called for his ouster. But, in the end, those two losses prevented me from fighting for him.
After the coaching change, I wrote this of Orgeron: ""He deserves to be a head coach somewhere, and his passion-driven style would work well in a small market with lower expectations.""
Yeah, like LSU in the Southeastern Conference? Yeah, I was an idiot. The Ed Orgeron era exposed lots of folks as idiots, none of whom were Ed Orgeron.
::
A year after his departure, Orgeron was kind enough to host me for a weekend visit at his New Orleans-area home, where he was unemployed and still hoping to return to the Trojans.
While attending a Friday night high school football game involving his son Parker, Orgeron pointed a giant finger when Parker pulled on a USC sweatshirt.
""That right there, that's my family forever,"" he said.
He meant it. He loved USC. He epitomized USC. This should have been obvious after his first big victory when the Trojans won at Oregon State for the first time in nine years.
After that game, I wrote: ""When it ended, Orgeron gathered his players around him for a unique postgame pep talk. They lifted him up. He ordered them to put him down. He then asked them to turn around and stare at the stands of the aging stadium that had spent the last couple of hours shaking. He wanted them to see the mostly vacant seats, a tangible sign of domination, the Trojans having sent the Oregon State fans scurrying into the cool night.""
And, it turns out, that wasn't even his most dramatic postgame moment. There were more chills after the Trojans beat fourth-ranked Stanford on a last-second field goal by Andre Heidari.
After that game, I wrote: ""The deep green Coliseum field turned cardinal and gold, swarmed by thousands of fans, enveloped in thousands of screams, the heart of a Trojan nation beating together in dizzy disbelief. In the middle stood one sweating man who was somehow bigger than all of it, his giant white-sleeve arms raised above his giant smile, his massive shoulders carrying this bear of a victory.
""He was rocked, he was hugged, he was loved like no man has been loved here since the early days of Pete Carroll.""
And then he wasn't, demoted less than 48 hours after the end of a mostly glorious season, and he wasn't the only one who cried.
Players openly wept. They loved the guy. That compelling scene Saturday at the Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York, where winner Burrow cried while talking about Orgeron's influence? Six years ago, USC players had talked to me about him in the same tones.
Said safety Su'a Cravens: ""Coach O needs to be here next year. ... We want Coach O next year. Forget the hiring, forget all that. We got Coach O, and that's all we need.""
Said linebacker Hayes Pullard: ""Any time you have a father figure like Coach O, he comes in here, treats us like his own, we want to run through a brick wall for him.""
Haden wasn't listening, a lot of people weren't listening, and you know what happened next.
When Sarkisian was dumped in October 2015 because of substance abuse issues, Helton became the interim because Orgeron was no longer on the staff, and the rest is mediocrity.
There has been recent talk that with USC's stand on integrity, it might not hire Orgeron today because of alleged violent incidents in the early 1990s, including a restraining order filed -- and eventually rescinded -- in 1991 by a Dade County (Fla.) woman who accused him of repeated violence. But in the nearly three decades since then, his life has been free of similar incidents.
It all came full circle for him recently after what was the biggest win of his coaching career and a game that surely made USC fans shiver.
Following LSU's 46-41 victory over Alabama on Nov. 9, Orgeron surely took special pride in staring across the field at the Crimson Tide's offensive coordinator.
Guy by the name of Steve Sarkisian.

"They're losing a lifeline; Many disabled adults rely on board-and-care homes, but those facilities are closing as state funding falls short","Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitThe news came in September: Long Beach Residential, a 49-bed home for adults who are mentally ill, was being sold. The residents of the converted apartment building, some of whom had lived there for decades, would have 60 days to move.
It's a scenario that is becoming increasingly common across California, brought on by a combination of an inadequate state funding system and California's red hot real estate market.
The problem is particularly acute in Los Angeles County, where board-and-care homes are disappearing even as hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to house homeless people. An April survey estimated that 39 such facilities had closed in the previous three years -- eliminating 949 beds out of an estimated 6,100. The board-and-care crisis is ""what keeps me awake at night,"" said Jonathan Sherin, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. ""We haven't paid attention to it for years. We've lost thousands of units.""

The homes -- which provide 24-hour staffing, serve three meals a day and administer medication -- are for adults with debilitating mental illness who are unable to care for themselves. Most residents are poor as well and, therefore, at high risk of homelessness.
Reimbursement for the services board-and-care homes provide, which is based on state budget allotments and Social Security levels, is currently about $35 a day per resident.
That rate has fallen so far behind inflation that operators say it is barely enough to cover food and pay their staffs. Some are struggling to maintain aging buildings that are worth more as real estate than as a business.
Earlier this year, the owner of a 70-bed facility in Claremont put her board-and-care up for sale for $4.3 million. Two years ago, a couple shut down a 100-bed home, demolished it and replaced it with market-rate apartments, saying they couldn't afford to keep it open and apartments are easier to manage.
""You don't have to come every day,"" one of the owners said. ""You don't have to be on the phone 24 hours. You don't have people harassing you.""
The couple still own a second board-and-care home that they've operated for 35 years. They're hoping for an increase in the reimbursement rate that will allow them to continue, but say they can't wait much longer.
""If I'm not going to get more money, I'm going to close,"" the owner said.
Owners barely breaking even
The Times contacted the owners of several board-and-care homes who said they were considering, or were in the process of, closing. Few would speak on the record, citing concerns about alarming their patients and staff or incurring unwanted attention from regulators.
Most were long-term owners who had first-name relationships with their residents, some knowing each other for decades. The owners said they were barely breaking even, and foresaw going into the red when the minimum wage goes up in the city of Los Angeles next July. They are not free to raise their prices, which are set by the state.
If residents are not fortunate enough to find a vacancy at another board-and-care, there is no assurance they will remain housed. Some may be taken back by frazzled families. Others may wind up in unlicensed homes. An unknown number land on the streets, in jail or in mental hospitals.
""I know what it's like when people die,"" said Barbara Wilson, a consultant who lost her own son to mental illness and homelessness. ""We're on the verge of having a lot of people die because of the lack of care.""
In a 2018 report titled ""A Call to Action,"" Wilson linked the board-and-care closures in L.A. County directly to the homelessness crisis. The homes, the report said, fill a housing niche for a population with disabilities that make them unable to live independently -- even in apartments with on-site services.
Caroline Kelly, a former member of the Los Angeles County Mental Health Commission who also had a role in writing the report, said this is especially true for adults with severe mental illness discharged from psychiatric hospitals.
""You have actually made progress and done well, you can't afford to move anywhere else,"" she said. ""You live on Social Security income and you don't qualify for housing because of the rules of who is eligible.""
The report identified eight homes in the county as being at risk of closing. Two of those since have shut down.
Other homes have been converted into lucrative businesses. When the Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse bought the 47-bed Eden Manor in South Gate, it scrapped plans to maintain it as a board-and-care and shifted to its core business of treating addiction.
""We couldn't afford to keep that program open,"" said Chris Borden, the agency's director of operations.
Residents of the home in Long Beach got a reprieve last month when the building's buyer failed to get financing for the $3.1-million sale. The owners pulled the facility off the market to stop the eviction process. But 12 residents had already moved, leaving a bigger hole in the budget.
Even more consequential than the loss of beds, said Sherin of the county Department of Mental Health, is the loss of the properties.
""It could take years and years, decades to re-site projects for people who are perennially excluded from our community,"" he said.
Alternative to state mental hospitals
Board-and-care homes licensed to serve people who are mentally ill were written into state law in the 1970s as a community alternative to the state mental hospitals that were being closed at the time. The Social Security-based funding led to a mission-driven, low-profit business model.
Advocates say there were never enough of the facilities to serve the population. But there is no official count of board-and-care beds because they are included in a licensing category with homes for people who are developmentally disabled -- facilities that are more numerous and better funded by the state.
Adding to the confusion, an unknown number of low-income people with mental illness live in homes for the elderly that are licensed under a different category.
At the request of Los Angeles County, the California Community Care Licensing Division conducted a survey to estimate the number of beds currently available for mentally ill adults. It found that there are about 154 homes in the county still open, with a total capacity of 5,129 beds. The 39 closures over three years represented a 16% decline.
Those facilities range from single-family homes with as few as six beds to apartment buildings with hundreds. Residents commonly share bedrooms and are prompted to take their prescribed medication, though they cannot be forced. Residents are free to come and go as they please.
Some serve families with resources or insurance and charge monthly rates as high as $10,000.
Most beds, it's not known exactly how many, serve those who can't pay. For them, the reimbursement rate is $1,058 per month -- or about $35 per day -- per bed. It's made up of the resident's Social Security disability payment and a state supplement for out-of-home care set by the annual budget process in Sacramento.
Last year, the Social Security rate went up by about $20. The state supplement, which was reduced during the Great Recession, hasn't been raised since 2017. Advocacy groups -- including the California Behavioral Health Planning Council and the Steinberg Institute, a nonprofit formed by Sacramento mayor and state homelessness task force co-chair Darrell Steinberg -- lobbied unsuccessfully this spring for an $18-million boost to bring the reimbursement rate to at least $2,000 per month.
The effort was hampered by a lack of solid data, both on the population being served and on the number of beds in need of the subsidy, said Adriana Ruelas, legislative affairs director for the Steinberg Institute.
Anecdotal evidence since collected by the California State Assn. of Counties and several other agencies suggests that about 40,000 people are eligible to live in board-and-care homes. The advocacy groups plan to try again next year.
Separately, a bill written by Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) would have required the California Department of Social Services to collect data on homes that accept mentally ill adults. The bill was held this year, but likely will be brought back before the state Legislature.
Responding to a mandate by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, Sherin has recommended additional strategies to address the funding problems. Among them, he said in an Oct. 23 report, would be to treat board-and-care homes as long-term housing so residents could qualify for state rental subsidy programs, such as Section 8, that currently exclude licensed facilities.
""For many people, particularly those with serious persistent mental illness, it's collaborative housing that is long-term,"" Sherin told The Times.
Most low-income board-and-care residents are alone in life, having lost all family connections, owners told The Times. But for parents struggling to provide the best life for their grown sons or daughters who are mentally ill, a board-and-care home can feel like salvation.
Lidia Miranda said she knew she could no longer handle her son when he injured himself in a suicide attempt and came home from the hospital in a wheelchair. She turned to Wilson, who recommended getting him into Blake Home, a six-bed board-and-care in Sylmar. The owner, Catherine Blake, has run the home since the 1980s and is now in her 90s. She's turned the operation over to her son, Sam -- in addition to his work as a contractor -- who cooks meals, does laundry and maintains the property.
""It was a godsend,"" Miranda said. ""It was a difficult transition because he was angry with us. He feels like we kicked him out.""
But in less than a year, she said, her son was able to move to a sober living home and eventually into an apartment with on-site services.
The Times reached out to several parents, most of whom asked to remain anonymous, keenly aware of the societal stigma of mental illness.
""Nobody wants to talk about it,"" said Wilson, admitting that she hid her son's mental illness from her own mother. ""There's huge shame. It's like, what did I do wrong as a parent.""
Sam Blake said he is going to keep the board-and-care home open for residents as long as his mother is alive. But at 71, he doesn't see a long future in the business.
""My niece who helps us out, and my son, they don't want no part of it,"" he said.
A 'patch' subsidy from L.A. County
Until help comes from the state in the form of higher reimbursements, the burden of a disintegrating board-and-care system will continue to fall primarily on counties, which have a legal responsibility in California to care for residents who are mentally ill.
In September, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and the Board of Supervisors put forward a plan to increase a local subsidy to $35, nearly double the state rate, and adopt an 18-month hold on board-and-care closures while the county explores ways to purchase homes before they close. Breed last month announced a homelessness plan to pump $200 million into mental health services and drug treatment.
Los Angeles County has responded to the crisis with a handful of initiatives, including providing an additional $750 per month -- called a ""patch"" subsidy -- for board-and-care residents who are receiving county services and determined to be high need.
According to Sherin's report, the subsidies are now going to 1,000 people.
Some board-and-care owners contacted by The Times said the extra money keeps them out of the red, but not by much.
The county's Department of Health Services also has used board-and-care homes to house about 1,000 formerly homeless people through its Housing for Health program, paying rates that vary based on each person's needs. And the agency has taken over operation of four homes that closed, saving them even though it was unable to prevent the eviction of those who lived there.
""They were already empty and/or in the process of being sold,"" said Cheri Todoroff, director of the Housing for Health program. ""We're really sensitive that we don't want to displace people.""
Advocates for comprehensive board-and-care reform worry that the county programs give owners an incentive to select only those residents who have been identified to receive additional subsidies, making it more difficult for others to access the services they need.
""Everybody now is discovering board-and-care homes,"" Wilson said.
""That's the ticket. It's a lot cheaper. But that leaves our people out. I have to scratch my head to figure out who has a bed, who that is still in business and will take my client.""

"Asians start speaking up for DACA; With Supreme Court ruling ahead, some say it's time for Asian recipients to be heard.","Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitDean Santos arrived in the U.S. from the Philippines when he was 12 and quickly took to American culture. In his teenage years in San Bruno, he played sword and fantasy card games with other kids, watched ""South Park"" and joined the high school wrestling team.
When he got to college, he became a member of the student government. By the time he was 20, he had begun to help organize young people who were in the country illegally.
""I taught them how to do lobby visits, how to set up meetings with elected officials, how to tell our stories to make ourselves heard,"" Santos said.

For Santos, who is now 29, it was personal: He has been in the U.S. without legal status since shortly after he arrived as a boy.
In the constellation of activism for those in the country illegally, Santos is in a decided minority -- an Asian immigrant fully open about his tenuous status in the United States. As the Supreme Court weighs the future of so-called Dreamers and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, he said he thinks more Asian and Pacific Islanders need to come out of the shadows. And he points to the advocacy among immigrants in other groups, particularly those from Mexico and Central America.
""They organize and show they have a stake in society, setting an example that others can follow,"" he added.
It is no easy task among a group of immigrants where a number of factors -- from shame to political affiliation -- make openness about being in the country illegally especially complicated.
Experts say Asian and Pacific Islander recipients of DACA are often overlooked despite there being more than 1.7 million undocumented members of this group in the country, according to May Sudhinaraset, assistant professor in community health sciences in the School of Public Health at UCLA. So-called APIs are the fastest-growing immigrant population in the nation, and in California represent one 1 in 5 immigrants without legal papers.
""Many are even unaware that APIs can also be undocumented,"" Sudhinaraset said.
She said research shows that among Asian and Pacific Islanders, there's little benefit from being open about one's undocumented status -- but a high chance of being exploited or looked down on.
""This results in shame and stigma associated with being undocumented, lack of support within their own communities, and threats of deportation or worker exploitation when people from their own communities find out they are undocumented,"" Sudhinaraset said.
In the Vietnamese community, for example, older immigrants tend to be Republican and conservative and often harbor hard-right opinions on illegal immigration. This can lead to arguments with younger Vietnamese Americans, who are often more liberal. Because illegal immigration is such a hot-button issue that often provokes harsh rhetoric -- including from the White House -- many Asian immigrants are glad for the relatively small spotlight that the issue has in their communities, experts say.
During oral arguments this month, the Supreme Court's conservative justices sounded skeptical about the Obama-era policy that has allowed 700,000 young immigrants to live and work in the U.S., which could suggest the court may clear the way for President Trump to end the program. The court is likely to make a decision by spring.
""We basically had a piece of legislation that gave us a purpose -- gave us energy,"" said Santos, who works at Immigrants Rising, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps undocumented young people achieve their career and educational goals. DACA ""helped define us and started getting some of us involved in fighting for our rights. But honestly, there's still not enough involvement.""
Emily Park, a medical student at UCLA, never knew the secret surrounding her immigration status until she applied for college. A native of South Korea, she traveled as a 9-year-old with her mother and two siblings from Seoul to America in 2001 ""on a trip that would change our lives.""
They carried tourist visas. Later, her mother applied to stay longer, but during the process a member from their legal team forgot to submit a key document ""that led us to losing our status, though that was hidden from us kids,"" Park, 28, recalled.
""I always knew something wasn't quite right, seeing how my single mom faced a lot of problems supporting us.""
The family lived in Orange and San Diego counties, with her mother bouncing between domestic jobs and moving from apartment to apartment. Park learned to keep her belongings simple and tidy -- just in case the family had to move again. She eventually enrolled at UC Berkeley, studying nutritional science, physiology and metabolism and did a stint as a community health worker at Asian Health Services in San Francisco's Chinatown. A Dreamer, Park sees DACA as a ""Band-Aid solution,"" but a necessary one.
""People have created new lives in this new country and try our best to contribute to society,"" she said. ""I can't explain why more Asians aren't visible when they should be visible talking about this issue. It takes a lot of bravery and sacrifices, but we have to do it.""
Hong-Mei Pang, director of advocacy for Chinese Affirmative Action in San Francisco, said the unclear future of DACA makes it high time for people to work closely, regardless of their backgrounds and countries of origin.
""For a long time, immigrants [were] pitted against each other in the debate about immigration reforms,"" she said. ""In this very moment when there are so many threats from the Trump administration, it really is time for us to band together with other communities of color to say that home is here.""
Akiko Aspillaga was 10 when she and her mother flew to the U.S. from Manila. Her mom received a work visa, which eventually expired. Even with DACA status, Aspillaga said, she has lived with a feeling of being under ""a constant cloud.""
Still, she followed her heart and this year married a Japanese man. Her husband stayed in his homeland and hopes his promised hiring by an employer willing to sponsor his move to New York will go through. Aspillaga, 30, said this and threats surrounding DACA have made her think about whether she will have to leave the country she has called home.
""For me, that's why I always work hard and keep saving and making backup plans,"" she said. ""We gotta have it. Plan A. Plan B. And C.""
Not knowing what would happen with her immigration status forced her, at one point, to juggle three nursing jobs -- balancing between an ambulatory surgical center, a primary care clinic and an urgent care facility. She had to save money for ""an unknown future"" for herself and her ailing mother, who had suffered from a bad fall last year that caused her brain to bleed.
""We're all in survival mode, now that we have a president who cares more about his political gain than how tens of thousands of lives are affected,"" said Aspillaga.
""DACA was never the end goal. You can apply and reapply. It's a temporary fix, but it's better than not having a fix before.""

| Jump to first hitOnce upon a time you might have been red-faced giving a secondhand sweater or a tin filled with homemade cookies for the holidays. It seemed out of step in a culture that pushes designer clothing, the newest action toys or S.U.V.s with giant red bows.Of course, extravagant gifts still overshadow the humbler ones. But there are signs that more Americans are taking a quiet stand against materialism. Some are just embracing simplicity and rejecting clutter, while others want to avoid overspending and debt. Still others worry about environmental waste and climate change.Whatever the reason, more people are giving and receiving used goods, making their own gifts, choosing ""experiences"" like cooking classes and travel, or even requesting charitable donations in their names or (gasp!) nothing at all for the holidays.First, a disclaimer: Retail still reigns.Nearly 190 million Americans shopped online or in stores over the Thanksgiving weekend this year, a 14 percent increase from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Most bought new merchandise, with only 7 percent doing even part of their shopping in thrift stores, said J. Craig Shearman, spokesman for the federation.But the preference for secondhand goods, homemade presents or experiences like going to the symphony or on exotic trips has continued to grow since 2016, when analysts began noticing the trend. Using online surveys of 1,700 shoppers in 2018, the market research firm Mintel found about a fifth of them agreed that ""experience gifts"" were superior to tangible goods. In 2019, a similar survey showed about half agreed with that.A different recent online survey found that roughly half the shoppers who responded would consider giving secondhand clothes and would also welcome such gifts. ""That whole stigma of secondhand is waning or really vaporizing,"" said Jill Standish, senior managing director for global retail consulting at Accenture, the consulting firm that conducted the research.Saving money evolved into saving the world.
Industry watchers say these alternative forms of giving started out as a way to save money but have quickly evolved as a way to reflect other values.One of those values: protecting the environment. Climate crisis warnings have more people picturing oceans filled with plastic and skies choked with smoke from textile mills in China. That clashes with images of presents lovingly wrapped in expensive paper under a live tree harvested and shipped from the countryside.Eva Raposa, 37, a business strategist in Martha's Vineyard, has told relatives that if they want to get her 8-year-old daughter a gift, they need to buy from the island's consignment shops.""I just started to feel very strange about how our relatives were lavishing my young daughter with items from overseas,"" Ms. Raposa said. ""It was fast fashion. It had love behind it, but to me it was junk.""And some say there is a sense that we have prioritized material possessions for our families and friends over something far more valuable: our time with them.Michelle Murré, owner of a luxury travel agency in St. Helena, Calif., said that in the last two years, she had noticed her client base grow in the months leading up to the holidays. Consumers ask her to organize motorcycle treks through Marrakesh, romantic getaways to Tuscany and family hikes in the Caribbean that they can give as holiday gifts.Clients are looking for ""lasting memories versus the gift that might be the big wow for a week or a month but will be forgotten,"" Ms. Murré said. ""It's a shared experience. They realize that these are the experiences that last a lifetime.""
Secondhand stores and consignment shops are thrilled.Who benefits from the trend? We just mentioned luxury travel agents. And obviously secondhand shops are downright giddy.Milo Bernstein, one of the owners of Ina, a group of four high-end consignment boutiques in New York, said sales at his stores used to drop off in November and December. That was when people stopped buying for themselves and began buying new retail for others.In the last four years, sales those months have stayed steady or even ticked up, a sign people are using consignment for holiday shopping.""Men would come in and say: 'I want to buy a Fendi bag for my girlfriend. Do you have the original box because I don't want her to think I didn't get a new bag'?"" Mr. Bernstein said.No more. Customers are more likely to brag to their loved ones that they bought them secondhand gifts, he said.""In some ways it's even better because you're contributing less to the world of waste,"" Mr. Bernstein said.The arts have also seen a boost. Bernadette Horgan, spokeswoman for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, said the organization sold 308 gift certificates in November and December this year, up from 253 during the same period last year and 196 in 2017. It is safe to assume those are mostly holiday gifts, she wrote in an email.Please tell me this isn't a millennial thing.Yes and no. The Mintel survey showed that the majority of respondents who identified as millennials or members of the even younger Generation Z preferred experiences over gifts.But 44 percent of shoppers who identified as Generation X and 40 percent of those who described themselves as baby boomers also said they would prefer the gift of an experience over something material.""That shows to me there is a universal agreement to how consumers are prioritizing what matters to them most,"" said Diana Smith, associate director for retail and apparel at Mintel.And when it came to buying or receiving secondhand gifts, there was no difference in attitudes among the age groups surveyed by Accenture, Ms. Standish said.More than half of the shoppers in that survey also said they wanted to know that products were made in sustainable or ethical ways.Adriana Compagnoni, 53, was motivated by that desire in 2012, when she began making homemade presents from the honey and beeswax she collected from the hives she keeps in her backyard in South Orange, N.J.""Maybe I was delusional, but I was pretty confident people would like it,"" said Ms. Compagnoni, who also sells the homemade items at holiday pop-ups. ""It's not a trinket that's going to end up in a landfill or cluttering their homes.""Will the trend continue? It looks that way.Just look at the numbers. In 2018 the secondhand market in the United States brought in $24 billion. By 2023, that figure is expected to grow to $51 billion, Ms. Standish of Accenture said.""This is where we're going forward as consumers are shopping more with their values and with social consciousness,"" Ms. Smith of Mintel said. ""It's kind of moved beyond a trend. It's just more a lifestyle choice and a reflection of how we're living our lives. People are defined more these days not by what they own but what they value, and their buying habits are reflecting that.""Still, she said, consumers need to consider whether it really is socially responsible to give luxury travel packages and restaurant gift certificates as presents, considering the carbon footprints of air travel and discarded food.""If you think about it, emphasizing experiences can lead to more waste,"" Ms. Smith said.PhotographDeShawn Wilson shopping at INA, a consignment store in Manhattan.

| Jump to first hitThree rising comics share an aesthetic that marries crass physical humor with disarmingly sexual themes. They're unsettling and hilarious.The most unsettling clown I saw this year was not the Joker or Pennywise, but a well-meaning jerk named Nate.Played by Natalie Palamides in drag, with hair drawn on her exposed chest, Nate rode a small motorcycle onto the Bell House stage in Brooklyn in June, stopping to chug beers, swing an ax, and wrestle and grope audience members -- with permission. This was a prelude to the really confrontational part, a solo dramatization of a date, an acrobatic act of puppetry with a mannequin, that ends with a question for the crowd: Was this rape?""Nate,"" a hit at the 2018 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, was a startlingly unusual creation -- a clown show about consent that managed to be funny and ferocious, broad and nuanced, a prank on the audience that felt like a tickle. Though the show was recently filmed for a comedy special produced by Amy Poehler, it's hard to imagine it will capture the daredevil energy in the room. I would have called it singular until last weekend, when I saw Courtney Pauroso's ""Gutterplum,"" another anarchic show from Los Angeles, which was filled with spilled fluids and elegantly crass physical humor.Pauroso and Palamides share a director (Phil Burgers, who goes by the name Dr. Brown) and a certain raucous aesthetic that proves that modern clowning can be not only scary and funny, but also disarmingly sexual. Call them carnal clowns.""Gutterplum,"" which runs for two more performances Saturday at Union Hall in Brooklyn, can seem like a companion piece to ""Nate,"" which sends up unhinged femininity instead of toxic masculinity. This show has a linear narrative that follows the sweep of the life of one woman, Dale Ravioli, from childhood to old age. But the story is not what you are going to be talking about afterward. It's the aggressively bizarre collection of moments, the flights of ridiculousness that you can't believe you are seeing.In no other show this year will you see an elderly character wearing a wig of pubic hair at her crotch while playing air guitar or a younger one spider-walking topless while growling demonically. Did I mention this freak-out of a performance also happens to be a tender romance?Early on in ""Gutterplum,"" whose title is never explained, Pauroso invites a man from the audience to play kick the can. This begins a series of vignettes tracing a relationship and the awakening of a sexual life in a few inventive gestures. There's a scene portraying puberty that resembles nothing so much as the transformation of a person into a werewolf, but the monster this time is a party girl who parrots sentences like ""I actually like the taste of beer"" and ""Don't tell my dad.""And yet, Pauroso doesn't sneer at its central character. The comedy comes from the juxtaposition of the outrageous and vulgar physicality with jarring notes of sentimentality. After doing a strip tease, which skewers objectification while taking part in it, Pauroso sings a heartfelt ballad.At the start of the show, she picks up a blue exercise ball and gently tosses it into the audience; after encouraging a patron to throw it back, it hits her in the face, catapulting her backward. She plays this game again with similar results. But the third time the audience member tosses it back, her blank-eyed innocence falls and she grabs it, fakes throwing it back and says pointedly: ""You think I can't catch a ball?""Over the next hour, Ravioli loses her virginity, falls in love, has an abortion, grows old, suffers loss and faces death. But the structure of the episodes follows the same pattern as that game of catch, inviting the audience to play, then shocking us with a trick. While she is always a step ahead, Pauroso pretends otherwise. Both she and Palamides are smart acts working hard to appear stupid.The same week that ""Gutterplum"" had its New York premiere, Zach Zucker, another young Los Angeles modern clown, put on his own pratfalling, beer-swilling clown performance in the character of Jack Tucker, the world's worst stand-up. Pumping his fists in the air, he strutted onstage, his fly undone, falling on his face, assisted by an intricate sound design that jacked up the energy. He is a familiar type: The comic with infinite confidence and no skill.These are all shows about fools out of their depth. While Zucker and Pauroso essentially create character sketches, Palamides, who has a background in theater -- first performing the character of Nate with the superb Philadelphia experimental troupe Pig Iron -- builds a more layered world around her buffoons, her comic bits pushing the action not toward a point so much as a thorny question.In ""Nate,"" she opens up a conversation about sexual assault in the #MeToo era, broaching the issue directly but also through the form of interactive theater itself.Every time a clown asks you to sniff the flower in his lapel then squirts water in your face, the laugh rests on a minor humiliation. Comedy often depends on ethically slippery manipulation, misleading setups and disorienting punch lines. Palamides makes the coercion in audience participation more explicit, forcing some uncomfortable questions.Along with ""Nate"" this summer, she presented another solo show, ""Laid,"" which began with her hatching out of a giant foam egg, only to then pull an egg out of her dress, crack it open and then, with a hot plate nearby, face a decision: Should I eat or raise it?Over and over, she replays this scene, sometimes emphasizing absurdity, other times pathos. It's a show about the anxiety of parenthood in which a fragile woman gets a huge amount of egg on her face. But it's also about a mother murdering her children. Keeping both options alive and telegraphed to the audience with a minimum of language is a hell of a juggling act.While these shows deal with dark subject matter, they somehow maintain a sunny optimism, perhaps a response to the stereotype of the sad clown, but just as likely, a reflection of personal taste.The new vaudevillians, like Bill Irwin and David Shiner who emerged in the 1980s and '90s, aimed to reinvigorate clowning by deconstructing or winking at classic tropes. These young performers seem less tethered to the legacy of bowler hats and giant shoes.As artists searching for originality often are, they borrow from a variety of sources, including burlesque, circus, experimental theater and stand-up. And perhaps what makes them seem so thrillingly unpredictable is that they don't seem to be reacting against a tradition as struggling to forge their own.PhotographCourtney Pauroso in ""Gutterplum,"" which is running at Union Hall in Brooklyn.

| Jump to first hitFor its new streaming service, Disney is reviving small movies in the mold of ""Old Yeller."" Expect to see another doggone hero, Santa's daughter and remakes of classics like ""Home Alone.""LOS ANGELES -- In 1957, millions of people plunked down 62 cents each to see ""Old Yeller,"" a simple, sentimental Disney movie about a boy and his doggone dog in post-Civil War Texas.The well-reviewed film -- ""a nice, trim little family picture,"" as The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called it -- was such a smash hit that Disney booked a return engagement a few years later. Once again, ""Old Yeller"" brought out the masses.Now try to imagine ""Old Yeller"" on a theater marquee today.I'll wait.Most likely, it wouldn't even get made. Too PG-rated. No superheroes. Limited overseas box-office potential.Art films aren't the only ones having a hard time getting noticed in theaters these days. Nice, trim little family pictures can't make the multiplex economics work either. Disney pulled the plug on the genre a few years ago, citing the soaring cost of marketing theatrical releases, the collapse of the DVD market (which used to provide a safety net) and competition from living room video-on-demand services. Instead, Disney retrenched to focus exclusively on effects-driven megamovies that jackhammer people away from their Facebook and Fortnite accounts.""We're really proud of those smaller films we were making -- 'Queen of Katwe,' 'McFarland, USA' -- but we couldn't get them to work as a business,"" Sean Bailey, the president of production for Disney's flagship movie division, said rather glumly. ""Theaters were no longer a hospitable home for them.""But never fear: The streaming era is here. Like a factory restarting an abandoned assembly line now that boom times have returned, Disney is reviving its smaller-scale movie operation to make content for Disney Plus, the company's Netflix-style streaming service that blasts off on Tuesday.Once again, Disney will make inspirational sports dramas, gentle teen romances, live-action animal adventure films and slapstick comedies -- original-to-screen stories in the spirit of beloved Disney movies like ""Remember the Titans"" (2000), ""The North Avenue Irregulars"" (1979), and, yes, ""Old Yeller.""""Togo,"" for instance, arrives on Disney Plus next month. Set in Alaska in 1925 and based on a true story, the $40 million film stars Willem Dafoe as a cranky musher. His top dog, Togo, once an unwanted runt, must summon the strength -- in his twilight years -- to do the impossible: lead a team of sled dogs through a blizzard and across a treacherous frozen lake so that medicine can be fetched for dying children back home. He's the only hope.""Got one more in you, pup?"" Dafoe's frontiersman asks, unsure himself of the answer.Filmed in the Canadian Rockies, ""Togo"" is an edge-of-your-seat adventure -- the cracking ice! the approaching cliff! -- with a puddle-of-tears ending. At a one test screening, even a macho security guard patrolling the theater for digital pirates was weeping. (I flat-out bawled.)""It's not just a push-the-buttons dog movie,"" Bailey said, the verve returning to his voice. ""It's an epic adventure that is wildly cinematic.""Disney Plus will serve up 10 new films during its first year. Budgets range between $20 million and $60 million.Grace VanderWaal, a 15-year-old known for winning the ""America's Got Talent"" televised talent show (trusty ukulele in tow), will make her acting debut in ""Stargirl,"" a bespoke little musical about being yourself and the thrill of young love. It has an indie vibe -- something on the sunnier end of the Sundance Film Festival, perhaps, with a hat tip to ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" an Independent Spirit Award winner in 2013.""The whole be-yourself thing can start to feel very narrow and preachy,"" said Julia Hart (""Fast Color""), who directed ""Stargirl."" ""I wanted to make something for young people that felt authentic.""And then there is ""Flora and Ulysses,"" which focuses on a cynical girl and a squirrel who develops superpowers after getting caught in a vacuum cleaner. The fast-rising filmmaker Lena Khan (""The Tiger Hunter"") is directing this comedic romp, adapted from Kate DiCamillo's children's book, which won the John Newbery Medal in 2014.Not silly enough? ""Noelle"" is a candy-coated Christmas comedy -- complete with a cutesy flying reindeer named Snowcone -- that stars Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter and Bill Hader as her AWOL brother. Suzanne Todd (""Bad Moms"") produced it.""Stargirl"" and ""Flora and Ulysses"" will arrive on Disney Plus in the coming months. ""Noelle"" will be available on Tuesday.""We've seen holiday films perform really well with our competitors,"" said Ricky Strauss, the president of content and marketing for Disney Plus. (Last December, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" was a colossal hit for Netflix, generating 20 million streams in its first week.)Some of the new films coming to Disney Plus are remakes. Also on Tuesday, for instance, subscribers will be able to stream a live-action version of ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955) with rescue dogs in the lead roles. ""It's a faithful retelling of the classic story, right down to the spaghetti-sharing scene,"" Strauss said.Disney gave the ""Siamese Cat Song"" the heave-ho, though. In recent years, that nasally number and the accompanying animation (cats with slanted eyes and buck teeth) have been criticized as perpetuating racist stereotypes about Asian people. To replace the sequence, the actress-musician Janelle Monáe (""Moonlight,"" ""Hidden Figures"") and her Wondaland artist collective wrote a new tune. The cats are now Devon Rexes.Inclusion reigns in the new ""Lady and the Tramp,"" which remains set in the South around 1910. Monáe also provides the voice for Peg, the tempestuous Tibetan spaniel who sings the bluesy ""He's a Tramp"" while cooling her heels in the pound. Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") gives Lady her voice, while Kiersey Clemons (""Dope"") plays Darling, the young wife who receives Lady as a Christmas present. Jock, the friendly Scottish terrier next door, is now female (with Ashley Jensen of ""Agatha Raisin"" doing the vocal work). Justin Theroux voices the Tramp.Disney Plus will eventually be home to new versions of ""Home Alone"" (1990), ""Night at the Museum"" (2006) and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (last rebooted in 2003). Those franchises became part of Disney's vast collection of intellectual property when its acquisition of 20th Century Fox became official this year.But Bailey, the production chief, emphasized that Disney Plus movies would, on the whole, allow the company to ""place bets on original-to-screen stories -- films that we love creatively but have become harder and harder to make succeed theatrically.""He pointed to ""Safety,"" a drama based on the true story of Ray Ray McElrathbey, who, as a football player for Clemson University in 2006, tried to secretly raise his 11-year-old brother on campus to protect him from their drug-addicted mother.Another example: ""Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made,"" an off-kilter comedic drama headed to Disney Plus next year. Directed by Tom McCarthy, ""Timmy Failure"" tells the meandering story of an extremely eccentric fifth grader (played by Winslow Fegley) and his trusty imaginary polar bear. The film, which cost about $42 million to make -- computer-generated polar bears are pricey -- takes place in present-day Oregon and follows the pair as they cluelessly investigate a potential hamster homicide and other ""crimes."" It is based on the best-selling children's book series by Stephan Pastis, who is also known for creating the ""Pearls Before Swine"" comic strip.""Movies like 'Timmy' don't really get made,"" McCarthy said by phone. ""It owes more to independent cinema than anything.""McCarthy's most recent movie, ""Spotlight,"" the newspaper drama about the Roman Catholic Church's cover-up of sexual abuse by priests, was named best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards. He won an Oscar for writing its screenplay with Josh Singer, and was nominated as best director. Which raises a question: Why did he decide to follow up that triumph, to flex his new power in Hollywood, by making a movie that would go straight to streaming, bypassing theaters completely?In truth, Disney had to do some serious cajoling. ""I flew to New York and begged him to consider it,"" Bailey said.The men had initially discussed ""Timmy Failure"" as a theatrical release; Disney then shifted its big-screen strategy. ""I was taken off guard, and I had to process it a bit,"" McCarthy said. ""Finally, I told them, 'Look, if I can make it like a movie, a real movie, then I'm in.' We made it where we wanted to, how we wanted to, with the cast we wanted to.""With McCarthy on board, Disney was able to telegraph its streaming ambitions to Hollywood: We have serious filmmakers making movies for Disney Plus -- it's not the kiddie table.PhotographWillem Dafoe stars in ""Togo,"" about an aging husky who leads a sled team through a blizzard to deliver medicine for dying children.

| Jump to first hitTable for one? It's not as bad as it sounds. Here's how to dine by yourself and enjoy every bite.When the ancient Roman politician Lucius Lucullus noticed his night's menu looking dull, he gave instructions to his cook to prepare a lavish, multiple-course feast. When the cook asked what type of guests to expect, he responded with indignation: ""Dost thou not know that today Lucullus dines with Lucullus?""For Lucullus, meals were more than a social exercise: They were a ritual in personal pleasure. Greek dignitaries, for instance, described their shame at how much money Lucullus had spent on a dinner for them. ""Some of this expense, my Grecian friends, is indeed on your account; most of it, however, is on account of Lucullus,"" he said.For those of us who never refer to ourselves in the third person and often eat a cold egg roll standing over the sink for dinner, Lucullus's attitude can feel more than a little foreign. Somehow all of the romance of food, drink and their various joys seems to go out the window when we go from eating with another person to dining with ourselves. And much of the advice available on eating alone amounts to ""bring a book"" (I have several hamburger-stained books that attest to this being a bad idea). Yet, there is a freedom in eating alone, even if we need a little help to relish in it: no discussions of what we should order, no small talk, no sharing.In her book ""Serve It Forth,"" the 20th century food writer M.F.K. Fisher described watching an elderly man eating alone with an almost religious reverence. He slowly consumed half an avocado sprinkled with powdered sugar and soaked in Russian kümmel liqueur. ""He was at peace, and aware -- aware that Lucullus dined with Lucullus for a reason,"" she wrote.Dine alone, but engage with othersFor the past eight years, Amanda Cohen, chef at Dirt Candy in New York City, has done Valentine's Day a little differently at her restaurant. Instead of the usual odes to coupledom, Ms. Cohen created a solo diner's tasting menu for the holiday. In the years since she started the tradition, a kind of community has formed, with regulars who come in alone but soon get to know the staff and other guests.""Make the most of it. Engage with your server; don't be afraid to ask for things,"" she said. ""I want your experience to be just as good as if you're two people, three people, four people, or if you're one person.""Go in with a strategyPsychologists have long tried to understand why the amount of time you spend alone does not necessarily correlate to how lonely you feel. In a study by the BBC in collaboration with academics from several universities in the United Kingdom, researchers found that some people who spent very little time alone reported high loneliness, whereas others who were often alone did not always report high loneliness.Megan Bruneau, a therapist and executive coach who has written about loneliness, has an idea about why some people thrive with alone time. ""They're more able to sit with the discomfort of passing emotions, and thus they don't fear them as much,"" she said in an email. ""They're more attuned to their own needs and practice self-care and self-compassion as necessary.""It all comes down to knowing your needs and coming up with coping mechanisms that work best for you, according to Ms. Bruneau. For some people that might mean sitting quietly and savoring each bite, but for others that could be phoning a friend while eating or even -- that most taboo dinnertime activity -- eating in front of the TV. As Ms. Bruneau put it, ""Sometimes we need a little AGT"" -- ""America's Got Talent"" -- with our BLT.""Embrace your guilty pleasuresWhile ""solo dining"" might conjure up images of a corner booth at a cafe or a bar stool at a local restaurant, the ultimate solo dining experience is eating home alone. It's when we're home alone -- with no one watching what we're eating, how or where -- that our quirks, eccentricities and guilty pleasures come out.Samantha Widder, now a graduate adviser for the food studies program at New York University, spent several months during her own graduate studies gathering accounts from 150 people of their food habits when eating alone. Responses showed a wide spectrum of food experiences, representing the joys, stigmas and even fears around eating alone. (One respondent said he would eat only soft food when eating by himself, for fear he would choke.)""I was thinking that I was going to find more of a celebratory tone, and there was more shame than I expected,"" Ms. Widder said.People described eating frozen food, takeout leftovers in bed, cold cuts slathered in mustard, and in more than one case an entire box of crackers with an entire block of cheese.""Personally, I find that if there's no one around then I can almost celebrate those habits and those things,"" Ms. Widder said, citing a love of processed food. Whether people felt fear or freedom, shame or pleasure seemed to come down to their own attitude.For her part, Ms. Widder said she found a certain comfort in the ubiquity of eating alone in a place like New York City. After all, if you're eating old pickles out of the fridge in a Brooklyn apartment, chances are that more than one neighbor is, too.Toast to yourselfIf dining alone still carries stigma and anxiety for many people, drinking alone might be the last frontier. But as Victoria James, a New York City sommelier and the beverage director at Cote, explained, treating yourself to a quality cocktail or a glass of wine can play a part in the richness of the experience. ""I think that the best way to savor a beverage when you're alone is just sort of have that recognition; toast to yourself,"" she said. ""I think it's a really beautiful thing. So first and foremost, celebrate that moment.""One of the challenges in dining alone is that so much of the best wine in a restaurant can come by the bottle. If the wines by the glass aren't what you're looking for, Ms. James suggested speaking to the server or sommelier to see if they have other bottles open for tasting. In many states, including California and New York, diners can take home an unfinished bottle of wine. Ms. James encouraged diners to spring for a bottle, have a glass or two and then use that bottle as a way to revisit the experience over the next few days.Practice mindful eatingMindfulness practice has entered mainstream culture in recent years, often as a way to reduce stress and boost self-awareness. The practice of mindfulness when it comes to food lends itself perfectly to eating alone, according to Lynn Rossy, Ph. D., president of the Center for Mindful Eating. When eating alone, it's easier to focus simply on the food: its colors, texture, taste, smell. For Ms. Rossy, mindful eating takes place before, during and after a meal. It's about deciding what you're hungry for, whether it's summer-ripe tomatoes or rich pasta, and focusing only on the act of eating.""Mindfulness in general, just that act of bringing your attention back to one thing over and over -- and just eating,"" she said. ""That trains us to have more attention and focus. We all could use a little more attention and focus in this world we live in.""Photograph(PHOTOGRAPH BY Eva Cremers FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1253Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitAfter 9,000 or so bylines, Pete Hamill has probably earned the opportunity to write the lead of his own profile.""Oh, I thought about it,"" Mr. Hamill said on a recent Friday morning, hunched over a walker in the kitchen of his brownstone apartment in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.""'Pete Hamill is 84,""' he said. ""'He's got stents in his heart'-- I do, I have four. 'He's got two broken hips. He has to go to dialysis three times a week. He's even got a pacemaker.""'""'But,""' he added, ""'he ain't done yet.""'Mr. Hamill was a star city columnist when such a thing was still possible. His gritty yet soaring dispatches about cops, immigrants and crooked City Hall cronies earned him a reputation as a tabloid poet, long before the word ""tabloid"" was synonymous with celebrity fluff.Even so, he never let the tabloids contain him. Mr. Hamill wrote acclaimed novels and mingled with movie stars. He interviewed legends of the 20th century like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Che Guevara, and palled around with Robert F. Kennedy.All of that makes Mr. Hamill a living archetype of a dying breed, the celebrity newspaperman -- famous enough that in 1977, Jimmy Breslin, his friend and fellow columnist at The New York Daily News, outed him for dating Jackie Onassis.Mr. Hamill rolls his eyes at such talk. He has no time for Hollywood, or legacy. Three years ago, he moved back to his native Brooklyn with his wife, Fukiko Aoki, and is now locked in a battle with his aging body to finish his 22nd and, he said, possibly last book, ""Back to the Old Country,"" a reminiscence about the borough that shaped him.""I grew up with what I call the 'Tenement Commandments,""' he said, dressed comfortably in black track pants and a sweatshirt. ""One of them was, 'Remember where you're from.""''Extra Innings'There may be another reason for his look back.In 2014, Mr. Hamill, then 79 and living in a TriBeCa loft, was feeling profoundly weak and tired, and was rushed to a hospital, where doctors discovered that he was in the first stages of kidney failure.On his third day in the hospital, he was in cardiac arrest. Doctors also found mysterious fractures of his pelvis and spine. Heavily medicated, he slipped into a medical coma, and remained there for nine days. Doctors told his wife he would never emerge.He emerged.In fact, he emerged in unusual fashion. ""When I came out of it, I started talking in Spanish,"" Mr. Hamill said. (He lived in Mexico as a young man, studying art on the G.I. Bill.)He also emerged with a mission: to return to Brooklyn after nearly 30 years. The place he landed sits some 20 blocks from the tenement where Mr. Hamill grew up in what is now known as South Slope.With its period moldings and overflowing bookcases, the parlor duplex is more cozy than opulent -- a home for a writer, or rather, two. (Ms. Aoki, whom he married in 1987, is a former bureau chief for Newsweek Japan and the author of 15 books.)The book he spends his days writing is not a memoir, precisely. He's already done one of those.""A Drinking Life,"" from 1994, recounted his childhood of stickball and street fights as the eldest of seven children of Catholic parents from Belfast, Northern Ireland; his rise from Brooklyn Eagle delivery boy to newspaper columnist; and his boozy nights at old writers' bars like the Lion's Head in Greenwich Village, which led to a messy breakup with alcohol. He quit cold turkey on New Year's Eve, 1972.""I didn't want to be an Irish stereotype,"" he said.His current book is a rumination on the Brooklyn of his youth: Prospect Park, Coney Island, Sunset Park and ""explaining the notion of home,"" he said. It is ""trying to make sense of a life"" now that he has moved into ""a period of extra innings.""""It's just looking and inhaling and remembering, which is, as you get older, harder because you don't remember the new,"" he said, seated in a white sofa in his living room, which was filled with family photos and music CDs. ""I can remember things from 1943, and sometimes not remember what the hell I had for breakfast.""No longer is Mr. Hamill the burly tough guy with the mournful eyes who had the rugged good looks of a television homicide detective. He is thinner now, decades of deadline stress etched into the lines of his face. He moves haltingly. His wife informed me that he would probably only have the energy for one hourlong interview at a time.Even so, Mr. Hamill seemed anything but defeated. Rather than sinking into the sofa, he perched on its edge, leaning into the conversation. He recounted his tales with energy and wit, his eyes bright as he tried to craft the perfect pull quote.If memory sometimes fails him, maybe it is because there is too much to remember. Legacy has been a major issue in Mr. Hamill's life of late, especially after the recent HBO documentary, ""Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists,"" which profiled Mr. Hamill and Jimmy Breslin -- two Irish outer-borough guys who became kings of the city, back when New Yorkers still announced who they were by the newspapers they read.The film is a celebration of an era both very recent and very lost, when the overflowing ashtray was as much a part of the newsroom landscape as the Royal manual typewriter, and Mr. Hamill and Mr. Breslin helped define the stories that defined New York.Brawler and BardThe two were friends, but opposites. Mr. Breslin was grandstanding, pugnacious, in love with the very idea of Jimmy Breslin. Mr. Hamill -- big-hearted, self-effacing, in love with the rhythms of the city and the poetry he found there.Even his moral outrage carried a hint of lyricism. In 1989, when Donald Trump took out full-page ads in city newspapers calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty following the arrest of the Central Park Five, the African-American and Latino teenagers accused -- wrongfully, it turned out -- the raping of Trisha Meili, the so-called Central Park Jogger, Mr. Hamill fired back:""Snarling and heartless and fraudulently tough, insisting on the virtues of stupidity, it was the epitome of blind negation,"" he wrote in Esquire. ""Hate was just another luxury.""In his columns, Mr. Hamill mastered an almost haiku-like brevity. ""Tabloid stories are highlight films,"" he said.But he also knew how to spread his wings. As a magazine writer for Esquire and New York Magazine, he rode the wave of New Journalism alongside Gay Talese, Gloria Steinem and Tom Wolfe (all of whom share recollections in ""Deadline Artists"").Mr. Hamill's 1969 article, ""The Revolt of the White Lower Middle Class,"" could have been written in 2016: ""The working-class white man is actually in revolt against taxes, joyless work, the double standards and short memories of professional politicians, hypocrisy and what he considers the debasement of the American dream.""""Any politician who leaves that white man out of the political equation,"" he added, ""does so at very large risk.""Mr. Hamill's writing was so New York that you could almost hear the subway rattling behind every sentence. But he never let the city constrict him. He filed dispatches from Belfast at the height of the sectarian Troubles, and from the battlefields of Vietnam.His intimate interview in Rolling Stone with John Lennon in 1975 has entered into Beatles lore, although the two got off to a rocky start. ""I hated him,"" Mr. Hamill said.The trouble started when Mr. Hamill found himself seated with the members of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones at a large table at a London club called the Ad Lib. The two almost came to blows when Lennon suggested that Yanks were not welcome.""Why don't you just get the hell out of here,"" Lennon said.""Why don't you make me?"" Mr. Hamill replied.As Mr. Hamill recounted in the 1980 New York Magazine article, ""The Death and Life of John Lennon"":""He stared at me, and I stared back. The Irish of Liverpool challenging the Irish of Brooklyn. The music pounded, and then, as if he had seen something that he recognized, he smiled and broke the stare and peered into the bottom of his glass.""Robert F. Kennedy was more than a subject. He was a friend, despite the fact that Kennedy, the scion, and Hamill, the tenement son, represented opposite ends of the Irish-American experience.Kennedy used to tag along with Mr. Hamill to blue-collar bars in Brooklyn to talk to constituents. And Mr. Hamill was only feet away when the senator was mortally wounded at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968. ""I could see him blinking,"" Mr. Hamill said. ""He didn't utter a word.""It would not be his last encounter with the Kennedy clan. A decade later, he found himself dating one of the most famous women in the world, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.No Time for TwitterThe HBO documentary dug deep into his relationships with famous women: he lived with Shirley MacLaine in Brooklyn; he brought Linda Ronstadt to Thanksgiving dinner at his sisters'; he almost clocked Ron Galella, the ur-paparazzo who hounded Mrs. Onassis for years.But it is a topic that Mr. Hamill is loathe to discuss. ""I really agree with García Márquez, who said once, that everybody's got three lives: public life, private life and a secret life,"" Mr. Hamill said in the HBO film. ""Private life is by invitation only. Secret life is nobody's business.""To him, the focus on his boldface paramours damaged the film. ""They spent more time on Jackie Onassis and Shirley MacLaine than on my wife, and I've had my wife for 35 years,"" he said. ""I don't want her feelings hurt by stupidity from 40 years ago.""Maybe that's an old-fashioned view. It wouldn't be his only one. Mr. Hamill is of a generation that believes that a man could learn to be a man by reading Hemingway. Last year, he published a new introduction to his 1998 book, ""Why Sinatra Matters.""Even so, he resists the idea of being an octogenarian wallowing in nostalgia, even if he did return to Kings County to write a book about lost Brooklyn. He is maybe halfway finished. Progress can be slow. ""It's hard to do legwork with two broken hips,"" he said with a weary smile.Legwork that day consisted of a brief house tour, with Mr. Hamill guiding his walker to get him through the kitchen to show off the large, and largely unfinished, yard in back.""The house was built in the 1870s, and you can see what this must have been,"" he said, surveying the backyards of the neighboring brownstones, which aside from a lack of clotheslines, looked much like they did in the days before the internet, or even television.""See that tree there, the big, thick one a couple yards back,"" he said, pointing toward a towering oak tree. ""Imagine when that was a kid here, 100 years ago.""If he squints, the new, cosmopolitan Brooklyn of Michelin-starred restaurants and glassy condominiums is not so different from the wartime Brooklyn he knew as a child. ""Until a helicopter comes over, flying to the Hamptons,"" he said.Those are observations he will mine for the book. Some days, he is able to put in a full day writing. On dialysis days, he comes home drained. ""I have to eat lunch -- vitamin L -- and take a nap before I begin to feel I'm able to do work. When I do, it's late in the day.""The news of the day brings its own form of distraction. ""Every day, it's another stupidity or tragedy,"" he said. ""To call Washington D.C. a moral pigsty would be an insult to pigs.""At least he can avoid the time suck of social media that plagues younger journalists. His last tweet was sent in 2015.""I don't do Twitter,"" he said. ""I don't do LinkedIn. I don't have enough time.""""And time,"" he said, ""is the most urgent four letter word when you're my age.""PhotographPete Hamill, journalist and author.

| Jump to first hitAn AARP executive's comment over ""OK, boomer"" has since been disavowed by the company, which issued an apology Wednesday evening, amid a wave of online backlash.  Myrna Blyth, senior vice president and editorial director at AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, drew criticism after responding to the ""OK, boomer"" phenomenon in an interview with Axios published Tuesday.  ""OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money,"" she told Axios.  The tagline, in which Gen Z and Millennials critique Baby Boomers for dismissing the concerns of younger generations, has gained notoriety through the social media app TikTok, and broadened its reach after drawing national media attention.  It was also deployed by a New Zealand lawmaker to shut down a heckler. Some Boomers, however, perceive ""OK, boomer"" to be an ageist comment.  Blyth's response received scorn online for being ""condescending"" and ""tone deaf. "" ""Way to be the arrogant, condescending face of what people hate about your generation,"" wrote one individual, while another quipped that she ""just proved she’s way out of touch with the concerns & struggles of anyone under 55. "" 'OK, boomer,' explained: Why are Gen Z and millennials calling out boomers on TikTok? A statement published by Jason Young, AARP's senior vice president of media relations, apologized for the comments, explaining that the point ""got divorced from its context. "" ""We regret how we made our case,"" reads the statement. ""We did not intend to contribute to an intergenerational feud that’s contrary to how we’ve worked for over six decades. "" Young clarified that Blyth's comment specifically referred to advertisers dismissing ""Americans age 50 and over"" due to notions that they are an audience that is difficult to target for marketing purposes. ""These stereotypes are not OK,"" he wrote.  ""AARP may officially represent Americans 50-plus, but we know our real work for the past 60 years has been to improve society – to tackle our nation’s biggest challenges,"" the statement said.

| Jump to first hitAlabama Montgomery: The state is offering money to help develop its inland ports. The Department of Economic and Community Affairs says it’s accepting applications for grants of as much as $1 million to help improve infrastructure at ports located away from the coast. Money could be used for improvements like storage, moorings, new construction and maintenance. The grants are being offered through a $5 million program created by state legislators this year. Alabama has inland ports along the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in western Alabama, and there are more port facilities located in Florence and in Jefferson County near Birmingham. The head of the state agency overseeing the program, Kenneth Boswell, says the grants will help inland ports increase cargo and get products to coastal areas.  Alaska Juneau: The state’s public defender agency is referring more cases to the Office of Public Advocacy because of conflicts of interest with other cases or clients, according to a state oversight report released Monday. The number of conflicts jeopardizes the primary defense role the agency plays because the more cases it cannot do, the more the Office of Public Advocacy and contract attorneys will do, the report said. The public defender agency inconsistently reports the number of cases it has, has had higher caseloads in offices where it has struggled to recruit and keep attorneys, and would be more efficient with additional support staff, according to the report, which also suggested the agency could more effectively use its resources. Public Defender Samantha Cherot says her agency cooperated in the review.  Arizona Tucson: A group of University of Arizona students is demanding the school’s president apologize for remarks he made using Native American stereotypes. Members of Native SOAR, a university mentoring program for Native American students, posted on social media Sunday that they want a face-to-face apology from President Robert Robbins, and he says he'll meet with them. According to the group, Robbins unexpectedly visited a class last month. He reportedly said he wasn’t trying to “pull an Elizabeth Warren,” but he had a DNA test done because he thought he might be part Cherokee. But he planned to get retested because of his “very high cheekbones. ” The group also wants Robbins to open a position on his senior leadership team for someone who can represent tribal communities.  Arkansas Little Rock: The state’s Department of Human Services is closing offices in four counties by the end of 2020. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the department issued a news release Monday announcing its plans to shut down offices in DeWitt, Clarendon, Booneville and Osceola. The department said it will also launch an application processing center in Osceola by June 2021. The center will employ about 50 people using positions that will be shifted from other areas of the state. It also noted the planned changes come after the department studied how its 85 county offices could be better located around the recipients of programs such as Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized child care. The county offices authorize and process applications for the programs.  California Los Angeles: Authorities seized more than $1. 5 billion worth of illegally grown marijuana plants in the state this year – an amount an industry expert said is roughly equal to its entire legal market – as part of an annual eradication program, officials said Monday. The raids netted more than 950,000 plants from nearly 350 growing operation sites this year through the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting program, an effort known as CAMP that dates to 1983 and is considered the nation’s largest illegal marijuana eradication program. Authorities could not estimate a street value of the plants seized and based their figures on wholesale prices of $1,600 per plant. But Jerred Kiloh, president of the United Cannabis Business Association, said wholesale costs are doubled for the retail market – meaning the enforcement operation netted more than $3 billion worth of illegally grown pot.  Colorado Grand Junction: A federal agency says rebuilding a sage-grouse population found only in Colorado and Utah could take more than 50 years and cost nearly $561 million. The Daily Sentinel reports the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has released a draft recovery plan for the Gunnison sage grouse, which is listed as a threatened species. Colorado Parks and Wildlife estimates the bird’s population at more than 3,000, primarily in the state’s Gunnison Basin. Officials say the bird is found only in eight western Colorado counties and one eastern Utah county. Planned recovery actions include invasive weed treatment and improved livestock grazing practices. The largest proposed expense is nearly $309 million to acquire conservation easements or purchase private lands.  Connecticut Bridgeport: Environmental officials are announcing $2. 6 million in grants for Long Island Sound conservation efforts. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency says 20 grants totaling $1. 4 million will benefit Connecticut, while $250,000 will go to efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont and the rest to New York. The money benefits local projects meant to improve water quality and restore habitat around the Long Island Sound watershed. In Connecticut, U. S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal says the matching funds will help communities install trash skimmers, restore salt marshes, spur growth of fish and bird populations, and support environmental education efforts. The EPA says the projects will treat 8. 2 million gallons of stormwater, collect 46,000 pounds of floating trash and prevent 17,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the vital estuary.  Delaware Wilmington: Amid deer hunting season and shorter days, the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is reminding drivers to be wary of deer. According to DNREC, at least half of all deer-involved crashes happen in the last three months of the year, with the highest number of deer hit on the roads occurring in late October through mid-November. A recent State Farm report showed that from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, drivers made 5,816 deer-vehicle crash insurance claims in Delaware, a 7% increase from the 5,435 during the same time period last year. This year, Delaware ranks 26th out of the 50 states and D. C. for where deer-vehicle collisions are most likely to occur, according to State Farm’s report.  District of Columbia Washington: An independent investigation has determined that a regulatory agency in the district didn’t properly handle a complaint about an illegal rooming house that later caught fire, killing two people. The Washington Post reports the investigation by an outside consulting firm hired by the district was made public Friday. The overcrowded row house caught fire in August, killing 9-year-old Yafet Solomon and 40-year-old Fitsum Kebede. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits. The investigation says authorities conducted only cursory property checks, didn’t follow up with the police officer who made the complaint, and ended their inquiry without appropriate approval or documentation.  Florida Tallahassee: The state Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether felons can be kept from voting if they haven’t paid fines, fees and restitution. Lawyers for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state officials, as well as those arguing on behalf of felons seeking their voting rights, will appear before the court Wednesday. Voters last year approved a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to most felons who have completed their sentences. But the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill requiring that all financial obligations related to their sentences be paid before rights could be restored. DeSantis signed the bill. Advocates for felons sued the state, saying the law implementing the amendment was equivalent to a poll tax. DeSantis asked the Supreme Court to clarify the amendment.  Georgia Stone Mountain: Billed as the largest Native American gathering in the state, the four-day Native American Festival and Pow Wow is preparing for this week’s showcase of the culture through dance, music and more. The festival will be held Thursday through Sunday at Stone Mountain Park. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the event will feature tribes from across the U. S. and Central America. According to the event’s website, visitors can learn about the culture through “dance, music, authentic craft demonstrations, cooking traditions, storytelling, wildlife presentations and more. ” Demonstrations will include skills such as flint-knapping, bow making, fire starting, open-fire cooking and pottery, plus an encampment where kids and adults can go inside traditional dwellings. Other popular highlights include the intertribal dance and drum competitions.  Hawaii Honolulu: The City Council has proposed a bill that would create a new property tax category for homeowners operating bed-and-breakfast establishments. The Star-Advertiser reports the City Council approved the first reading of the bill last month. City officials say the bill could be in effect by July 1 if passed. Officials say tax rates for each category are determined by ordinance by the Council each June. Officials say the new category could fall somewhere between the standard residential category – currently $3. 50 for every $1,000 of assessed value – and the $13. 90 hotel-resort category. City officials expect to issue up to 1,700 new permits for hosted B&B operations starting in October 2020 after the Council approved a new vacation rental ordinance in June.  Idaho Boise: The state’s Department of Health and Welfare says 10 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related illnesses. Boise television station KTVB reports health officials say no single substance has been associated with the cases. The illnesses are marked by respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. Nationwide, roughly 33 people have died and nearly 1,900 people have been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those numbers are expected to rise because of a lag in reporting.  Illinois Chicago: Public housing residents in the city are being told they can’t smoke marijuana at home, even as pot turns legal in the state Jan. 1. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the Chicago Housing Authority began sending notices last week. The agency says it can terminate public aid if anyone is using marijuana for recreational or medical purposes on CHA property. CHA says marijuana is illegal under federal law, and it must follow the law to get federal money. Medical marijuana cards have been available in Illinois since 2014. Kate Walz of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law says people in public housing “don’t have the same rights as the rest of us do. ” Jacqueline Reynolds says she’ll keep sparking a joint. The 67-year-old says marijuana keeps her off blood pressure medication.  Indiana Lafayette: Three years after it was plucked from its perch near an Interstate 65 exit, the clock that was a local icon on top of the Hour Time Restaurant for four decades has a new owner and could have a new home soon. Lorne Koehler-Marsh, a landscaper who collects and repairs clocks, says he bought the clock – with its four 12-foot faces – with hopes of mounting it atop a tower at the front of a shop he wants to build on family property in Dayton. He says he’d hoped to buy the clock when memorabilia and fixtures at the Hour Time first went up for auction in 2016. But he skipped the auction, figuring the price would be too salty. “When I saw what it sold for,” Koehler-Marsh says, “I thought, ‘Crap, I wish I’d gone. ’ ” It went for $7,500, and he finally convinced the new owner to part with it last month. The clock dates to 1910, built in Leicester, England. Weighing in at 7 tons, it originally sat on top of a train station in Rochdale, England.  Iowa Madrid: The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation says it’s buying Clover Woods Camp & Retreat Center from the Iowa 4-H Foundation. The Natural Heritage Foundation said in a news release Monday that it’s made a deal for all 1,011 acres along the Des Moines River in Boone County. The price won’t be disclosed until the closing later this year. The 4-H Foundation was formed in 1949 to build the camp. It’s split into separate “villages” and includes a ropes course, climbing tower, swimming pool and 20 miles of trails. Iowa 4-H Foundation Executive Director Emily Saveraid has said the needs of 4-H participants and their families have changed, and they now prefer camping options closer to home. She says the foundation will focus more on camping and other outdoor activities at the county and regional levels.  Kansas Topeka: A federal judge has delayed the trial of an Army infantry soldier who prosecutors say is a Satanist hoping to overthrow the U. S. government and distributed information about building bombs. U. S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree in Topeka on Monday granted a request from attorneys for Jarrett William Smith to postpone a trial from early December until at least mid-January. Smith pleaded not guilty in September to charges of distributing explosives information and making a threatening interstate communication. His attorneys said they needed more time to review evidence. Smith was a private stationed at Fort Riley. He’s accused of providing information about explosives to an FBI undercover agent and threatening to burn down the house of a far-left-leaning “antifa” member. Authorities say he also wanted to car bomb a major news organization.  Kentucky Frankfort: Officials say programs at Murray State University and Bluegrass Community and Technical College offer a certification ensuring graduates have essential employability skills that employers say are often lacking. A statement from the Council on Postsecondary Education says the Essential Employability Qualities certification tells employers that academic programs integrate skills into the curriculum including communication, collaboration, problem solving and ethics. The statement says two programs at Murray State are certified, as is one program at Bluegrass Community and Technical College. Officials say four other campuses are pursuing certification in at least three programs: Kentucky State University, University of Kentucky, Gateway Community and Technical College, and Jefferson Community and Technical College.  Louisiana New Orleans: More than 200 years after the largest slave rebellion in American history, hundreds of reenactors will retrace their journey through the sugar plantation country of southeastern Louisiana. The reenactment was conceived by artist Dread Scott. His work focuses on racial injustice and oppression. The reenactors will dress in period costumes and carry machetes or muskets as they march 26 miles Friday and Saturday from LaPlace to the New Orleans outskirts. Scott says the project sprung from his interest in concepts of how people liberate themselves. He was also intrigued at learning about the little-known rebellion’s goals and how close it came to success. The slaves who carried out the rebellion intended to establish a free republic in New Orleans, but it was viciously put down.  Maine Portland: Scientists and leaders from New England and Canada are gathering in Maine this week for an event focused on what the warming of the ocean will mean for the region. The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium is taking place in Portland until Friday. Organizers say the event’s purpose is to “increase our collective understanding about how the Gulf of Maine is expected to change over the next 30 years and to promote regional resilience in the context of those changes. ” The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. It’s also home to some of America’s most important fisheries, such as the lobster harvest. Among the keynote speakers is Ko Barrett, vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Maryland Baltimore: Preliminary approval has been granted by the City Council to ban retailers from giving out plastic bags. The Baltimore Sun reports the council voted 13-1 on Monday night to ban the use of plastic bags and charge 5 cents to give any other kind of bag, including paper bags, to customers. Retailers would keep 4 cents of the fee, and the city would get 1 cent. Some products, such as newspapers, would be exempt from the rule. Another vote is planned for Nov. 18. If approved, the bill would advance to the mayor’s desk. He could sign the ban or allow it to take effect without his signature. Councilwoman Danielle McCray was the only person to vote against the proposal. She didn’t say why she opposed it.  Massachusetts Boston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is planning to spend $10 billion to $28 billion on updates to the commuter rail. The Boston Herald reports the Fiscal and Management Control Board approved a series of resolutions Monday directing the MBTA to start working on an overhaul of the commuter rail. The project is intended to decrease the number of commuters traveling by car by 2040. Potential updates could include the electrification of main commuter rail lines and running trains every 15 to 20 minutes all day. The most expensive version of these plans would include building a tunnel linking North and South stations. Gov. Charlie Baker would not confirm how the multibillion-dollar project will be funded.  Michigan Detroit: Police officers, firefighters and paramedics in the city will be recognized for exceptional service to the community. The annual Above and Beyond Awards ceremony is scheduled Wednesday at the MGM Grand in Detroit. Those recognized will include 19 officers from the 5th and 9th precincts who helped evacuate more than 100 people from a burning apartment complex for the elderly Sept. 23. Detroit Emergency Medical Services Asst. Superintendent Joseph Barney said he arrived to see “a swarm” of officers “literally running into the building like a flood. ” He added that their “actions certainly saved lives. ” Paramedics Justin Kidd and Madison Stitt will receive Medal of Valor awards. On May 8, they helped stop an attack by a pitbull on a 13-year-old girl. The awards are presented by the Detroit Public Safety Foundation.  Minnesota Minneapolis: Wildlife managers say they’re close to rounding up enough trash bins to dispose of deer carcasses in zones of the state where they’re trying to stop the spread of chronic wasting disease. One vendor, Waste Management, recently decided not to accept carcasses that potentially might be contaminated. That has sent the Department of Natural Resources scrambling to find replacements ahead of Saturday’s firearms deer season opener. DNR wildlife health program supervisor Michelle Carstensen told reporters Monday that she’s not sure if they’ll hit their goal of 26 dumpsters statewide, but there’s a good chance they’ll have 20. The DNR requires hunters in parts of southeastern, central and north-central Minnesota where diseased deer have been found to submit their deer for mandatory testing, and it urges them to use designated bins for disposing of carcasses.  Mississippi Jackson: Pet dogs can now dine with their owners under certain conditions at restaurants. The Mississippi State Department of Health’s new policy went into effect Friday. Restaurants must apply for a variance to the department’s food code to allow the animals and pay a $165 inspection fee. Under the new policy, a restaurant must have a separate outside entrance into a designated outdoor, dog-friendly area. Dogs, who must remain leashed, are not allowed to go indoors – unless considered a service dog. Disposable dishes and utensils are required, and dogs can’t come into contact with any items involved in food service operations. Employees cannot touch or handle the animals. More information is available online.  Missouri Columbia: After spending eight days in a tree to protest construction of a mid-Missouri nature trail, activist Sutu Forte has been arrested. The Columbia Missourian reports that city authorities on Tuesday removed Forte from the tree by using a fire truck’s hydraulic bucket. She was handcuffed and taken to jail but released a short time later. Forte says the police “handcuffed me very gently. ” One of her supporters held the summons Forte was given by police that indicated a charge of first-degree trespassing. Police Chief Geoff Jones and a city spokesman declined comment. Supporters in the crowd sang “This Little Light of Mine” as Forte was brought down from the tree. Forte had staged the protest since Oct. 28 over concerns that the trail extension would lead to forest destruction.  Montana Missoula: The city is not known for moose, but there will be a lot more “PaddleHeads” around when the next baseball season opens. The Missoula Osprey announced plans Monday to change its name to PaddleHeads with an updated logo and merchandise displaying the moose nickname, The Missoulian reports. The team decided 11 months ago to change its nickname as part of a rebranding to revive falling attendance. The Rookie Advanced affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks plays in the Pioneer League from June to September. The organization received nearly 500 name suggestions submitted online, and team officials were on a conference call with a consultant in March discussing the six finalists, says Matt Ellis, team executive vice president. Of PaddleHeads, “I said, ‘I’ve got one problem: I don’t equate a moose to the heart of Missoula. ’ Just then our phones lit up with an alert,” Ellis says. “There was a moose in downtown Missoula, a block from our office. ” Nebraska Yutan: The Nebraska Army National Guard has established a new infantry battalion – an outfit that a general says could help recruitment. The 2nd Battalion, 134th Infantry Regiment was activated during a ceremony Saturday at the guard’s parachute landing area near Yutan. It was followed by a parachute jump by more than 100 members from a helicopter hovering 1,000 feet in the air. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the Nebraska Army National Guard has been dominated by support units for years. Brig. Gen. Lynn Heng, the Nebraska Army Guard’s land component commander, says adding an infantry battalion should boost state recruiting. He says the new battalion is “a very attractive unit for these young folks who are looking for adventure, joining the guard. ” Nevada Las Vegas: Public safety officials in the state are beginning a drive to improve pedestrian safety with chalk silhouettes on roads, reflective bands for people crossing streets, and advisories for motorists. Vulnerable Road Users Project chief Erin Breen at UNLV says a “Dusk 2 Dawn” campaign kicked off Monday in and around Las Vegas, where 91 white outlines mark spots where pedestrians have died in recent years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ranked Nevada the fifth-most-dangerous state for pedestrians in 2017, with a little more than three pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 residents. Clark County, including Las Vegas, ranked 11th among 25 counties in the U. S. with the highest number of pedestrian fatalities per year in 2014 through 2018. Officials say pedestrian fatalities tend to increase during evening darkness following the end of daylight saving time.  New Hampshire Allenstown: A graveside service is planned for two suspected victims of a serial killer who were identified decades after their remains were discovered in a barrel in 1985. A public service is scheduled Saturday afternoon at Saint John the Baptist Cemetery for Marlyse Honeychurch, 24, and 6-year-old daughter Marie Vaughn. They were buried in an Allenstown cemetery with a headstone that said they were known “only to God. ” Authorities found a total of four decomposed bodies. This year, they confirmed the identities of Honeychurch, Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, another daughter of Honeychurch. The victims’ families said in a statement that they “are grateful to the residents of Allenstown who never ceased in their compassion, thoughts and prayers for these young women. ” New Jersey Madison: Weather authorities have confirmed it was a tornado that damaged homes and vehicles in northern New Jersey on Halloween night. The National Weather Service says the EF-1 tornado in Morris County touched down in Harding Township shortly before 12:30 a. m. Friday packing winds up to 100 mph. The twister snapped trees and brought down utility lines while traveling almost 5 miles to the borough of Florham Park. At Drew University, it brought down numerous trees, some of them crushing several vehicles. Another tree northeast of downtown Madison crushed the front porch of a home and another uprooted tree fell onto another residence. No injuries were reported. NJ. com reports the storms knocked power out to about a quarter of Madison’s homes and businesses.  New Mexico Santa Fe: The state Supreme Court debated Monday whether a murder defendant should have been allowed to introduce evidence that he has a genetic predisposition to violence. At issue is whether a district court acted properly in excluding evidence of a so-called warrior gene variant linked to a predisposition toward aggressive and violent behavior as it weighed murder charges against Anthony Blas Yepez. The Supreme Court listened to oral arguments from opposing attorneys without yet issuing a decision. Yepez was convicted in the killing of his girlfriend’s 75-year-old step-grandfather during a domestic dispute in 2012. He is serving a 22-year sentence for second-degree murder with additional time for auto theft and tampering with evidence.  New York Niagara: Parks officials are monitoring a century-old grounded barge that briefly broke loose during a storm last week in the river just above Niagara Falls. WGRZ says the rusty iron scow had been stuck since 1918 on rocks in the upper rapids above the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. High winds and rain last Thursday dislodged it before it got stuck again. The Washington Post says it was originally about a third of a mile from the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Then it moved about 164 feet downstream and became lodged again. A Niagara Parks official said it could be stuck in its new location for days or years.  North Carolina Waynesville: An attempt to tree a bear has ended with a hunter injured and the bear dead. North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission Capt. Andrew Helton says the hunter rolled off a slight cliff with the 350-pound bear Saturday. He says the hunter was with another man who had shot the bear while it was in a tree near Mount Sterling in Haywood County. The bear fell out of the tree and began biting the hunter. The bear walked away after the two tumbled off the cliff. Helton says Wildlife Resource officers found the bear dead Sunday. It was taken to a state Department of Agriculture lab for rabies testing. The hunter was taken to a hospital in Asheville with several injuries.  North Dakota Bismarck: State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has asked South Dakota authorities to help investigate an agency that allegedly violated state law on contract bidding. Auditor Joshua Gallion released a report last month that said the Department of Commerce violated the law on bidding uncompetitive contracts totaling more than $87,000 for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. The logo sparked criticism earlier this year when the contract for it was awarded to a Minnesota firm headed by a woman who once worked for Gov. Doug Burgum’s old Fargo software business. In a letter, Stenehjem does not give a reason for asking for South Dakota’s help but says it’s allowed under North Dakota law. The Commerce Department says it did nothing wrong but has identified where some improvements can be made.  Ohio Cincinnati: An arena has a new name after U. S. Bank decided not to renew its naming rights agreement with the site. Officials have announced the new name of the former U. S. Bank Arena will be Heritage Bank Center. The 17,000-seat indoor arena downtown has been the host to musical acts including James Brown and Led Zeppelin, as well as the home arena for the Cincinnati Cyclones hockey team. It has had several names since first opening in 1975 as Riverfront Coliseum. Chris Caddell, chairman of Erlanger, Kentucky-based Heritage Bank, said Monday that the center plans to attract events with the power to draw people from the region and beyond. Financial details of the 10-year naming rights agreement with arena owner Nederlander Entertainment weren’t disclosed.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: Supporters of a proposal to expand Medicaid say they have enough signatures to put a state question on the ballot next year. The Oklahoman reports that Yes on 802’s campaign manager Amber England says the community organization collected the state requirement of 178,000 signatures, which must be verified. The proposed question would amend the state’s constitution and expand Medicaid coverage to adults between ages 18 and 65 whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level. The conservative think tank Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs challenged the initial plan, but the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked it.  Oregon West Linn: A 130-year-old paper mill is back open, two years after its abrupt closure. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the newly formed Willamette Falls Paper Co. restarted two months ago and is now trying out new classes of paper made from pulp and agricultural waste instead of wood. The mill said Monday that it plans to begin commercial production of coated and uncoated papers by mid-month. The plant closed in October 2017, citing “unforeseeable events” that reduced available pulp for making paper. The shutdown cost 250 workers their jobs. Earlier this year, Clark County investor Ken Peterson made a “multimillion-dollar” investment to get the mill operational again. Willamette Falls originally planned to hire 85 at the restarted mill but now employs 120, according to Phil Harding, the mill’s director of technology and sustainability.  Pennsylvania New Castle: An election official didn’t think anything of the absentee ballot application until he saw the out-of-this-world voting location. The New Castle News reports the application to Lawrence County’s voter services department listed the location as “International Space Station, low Earth orbit. ” Director Ed Allison says his reaction was “What?” But then he found out that astronaut Andrew “Drew” Morgan, currently on the space station, has an address in Neshannock Township and is a registered voter in the county. County IT director Rick DiBello set up a secure email and password and a fillable PDF file that Morgan received, filled out and sent back. DiBello says he thought “that is pretty cool. ” And Allison calls it “very, very cool” and says: “This is the future. ” Rhode Island Providence: The state has launched a new program to make more electric vehicle charging stations accessible to drivers. The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources says it launched Electrify RI as an electric vehicle charging station incentive program. The $1. 4 million program will help fund the installation of new charging stations at workplaces, multi-unit dwellings, and state, quasi-public and local government properties. The money is coming from a government settlement with Volkswagen, which modified vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. State Energy Commissioner Carol Grant says she wants to make it easier for people to install charging stations and “inspire drivers to go green,” to reduce transportation-related carbon emissions and pollutants.  South Carolina Columbia: A group of moderate senators restored exceptions for rape and incest Tuesday to a measure to ban nearly all abortions in the state, sending the bill to the state Senate floor for a potential 2020 election year fight. The exceptions may be crucial for the bill to have any chance to pass. A proposal to ban abortions without them failed last year in South Carolina’s Republican-dominated Senate. The chamber is the last hurdle for the Fetal Heartbeat Protection from Abortion Act, which would make almost all abortions illegal once fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks after conception. The bill has always allowed an abortion if the mother’s life is in danger. It easily passed the House in April once the rape and incest exceptions were added, and Gov. Henry McMaster has said he will sign it no matter what.  South Dakota Sioux Falls: City councilors are considering whether to lift a ban on beekeeping. Two councilors have been working on the proposal to keep beehives within city limits for nearly a year. Theresa Stehly and Janet Brekke see beekeeping as a benefit to the environment. Their proposal creates a regulated system involving permits and fees along with education and training requirements. Ahead of Tuesday night’s City Council meeting, Sioux Falls Animal Control Supervisor Julie DeJong said her officers will need to ensure they’re equipped to hand bee-related emergencies, should the proposal pass. The Rapid City Journal reports that in 2016 several people were injured and a dog was killed by bees that were being raised in Sturgis that had become agitated.  Tennessee Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee says his administration is gearing up to use a portion of its $732 million in reserves from a federal welfare program for families with children. The large surplus has come under scrutiny after first being flagged last month in a report by the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a conservative think tank. According to the report, the state receives $190. 9 million annually through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program but last year spent just $71. 1 million of that money. Lee, a Republican, initially defended the reserve amount by arguing that the surplus would provide a cushion for a potential future economic downturn. However, on Monday, Lee told reporters he was open to using the surplus on a variety of options to continue helping Tennessee’s poor.  Texas Dallas: A man previously freed after spending 15 years in prison for the 2001 killing of a teenager has been formally exonerated. The Dallas County district attorney’s office says the state’s top criminal court issued a ruling of “actual innocence” Monday in the case of Quintin Lee Alonzo. The 39-year-old Alonzo, who was in prison on a life sentence, was released in May 2018. He was convicted of murder in 2003 in the death of 18-year-old Santos Gauna, who was killed when a fight broke out at a Dallas party Alonzo attended. Another man confessed to Gauna’s killing in 2015 before he was executed for a different crime. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ ruling allows Alonzo to seek state compensation for being falsely imprisoned. The district attorney’s office says Alonzo’s is its 41st exoneration since 2001.  Utah Ogden: A state lawmaker says she’s working on a proposal to study how implicit racial biases may play into the disproportionate number of minorities in the state prison system. Republican Rep. Marsha Judkins of Provo tells the Standard-Examiner she’s working on a prosecution transparency bill to be introduced next year that would require the collection of data about arrest, charging, sentencing and parole decisions. Utah Sentencing Commission numbers show 43% of people newly sentenced to prison in 2017 were racial or ethnic minorities. Census data shows minorities made up 20% of the population. Judkins says the statistics point to clear racial disparities. But without specific data, it’s hard to determine what’s driving it. The issue is important because Utah’s prison population is rising faster than any other state but Idaho.  Vermont Burke: The federal receiver overseeing two ski resorts in the state after their owner was accused of massive fraud says Burke Mountain Resort will not be sold for at least a year. Michael Goldberg said in court filings earlier this month that he hoped to sell Jay Peak Resort by the summer of 2020. He also wrote that he was “fairly certain” the investors “will incur a significant loss of their principal investment. ” Foreigners invested in various developments at Jay Peak through the EB-5 visa program, which helps them obtain permanent residency by investing at least $500,000 in job-creating developments in the U. S. Goldberg told the Caledonian Record that projects at Burke may not have created enough jobs under the EB-5 visa program, so the resort cannot be sold yet.  Virginia Richmond: The state has added more than 300 acres to natural area preserves, including land near the Appalachian Trail. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Friday that the Department of Conservation and Recreation had acquired land around the state that will help protect rare plants and animals. That includes land in the Antioch Pines Natural Area Preserve in Isle of Wight County, the Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve in Floyd County, and the Bald Knob Natural Area Preserve in Franklin County. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club and the state also will share ownership of 125 acres in Rockingham County next to Shenandoah National Park.  Washington Vancouver: Protesters at the Port of Vancouver, Washington, took steps Tuesday morning to block a shipment of pipeline meant for the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project. KOIN reports at least five people climbed up and chained themselves on the dock off which the shipment was to be loaded. Other “kayaktivists” were in the surrounding water, rallying behind the climbers to stop this project they say “is jeopardizing a livable future for everyone on this planet. ” Local law enforcement and the Coast Guard were monitoring the situation. The Trans Mountain Pipeline carries crude oil from the Alberta tar sands to the British Columbia coast for export. The expansion project would add a second parallel line that would nearly triple the system’s capacity.  West Virginia Morgantown: Police say they have identified a source of suspected heroin-laced vaping solutions while investigating overdoses that sickened two high school students. Morgantown Police Chief Ed Preston says in a news release that an underage high school student has been identified as a suspect. Preston says detectives obtained a search warrant that resulted in the recovery of more than 100 charged vaping solutions, packaging materials, marijuana and empty vaping cartridges that were being filled with the suspected solution. Preston says one of the vaping pens was confirmed to be contaminated with heroin and other dangerous chemicals. Morgantown police spokesman Andrew Stacy says the exact source of the vaping pens that made the students sick last week remains under investigation.  Wisconsin Milwaukee: The 2019 Milwaukee Film Festival pulled in a record 87,618 fans in its 15-day run, the festival’s nonprofit operator Milwaukee Film announced Tuesday. Attendance for the film festival, which concluded its run on a snowy Halloween, was up nearly 12% from 2018, when the festival had attendance of 78,510. Last year’s tally was a 6% drop from the previous year. Attendance totals for 2019 include 8,440 students who took part in education screenings at the festival’s home base, the Oriental Theatre. At the festival, the documentary “Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am” received the Allan H. (Bud) and Suzanne L. Selig Audience Award for best feature, and “Tree #3” received the Selig Audience Award for best short film.  Wyoming Cheyenne: The state Department of Education has named a conference room after the longest-serving department employee to commemorate decades of her work. Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports Superintendent Jillian Balow honored Rita Watson on Monday with a plaque and surprise dedication for her 50-year work anniversary. Department officials say Watson, her husband and Balow ate with Gov. Mark Gordon and his wife Friday to celebrate the milestone. Officials say they plan to place a plaque outside the room as a tribute to her career. Balow says Watson has worked for every superintendent of public instruction since 1974. Watson says one of her favorite parts of the job was enabling others to do their best, and she hopes to be remembered by her work ethic and love for the job.

| Jump to first hitRadio host Bob Lonsberry is being criticized after comparing the word ""boomer"" to the N-word.  The phrase ""OK, boomer"" has been used on the video sharing app TikTok by Generation Z and millennials to show their resentment toward baby boomers.  In a since-deleted tweet, Lonsberry, 60, said ""'Boomer' is the n-word of ageism,"" according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.  ""Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new,” he continued.  The Monday tweet garnered attention in the form of thousands of replies.  ""Just because something is insulting, it doesn't make it the N-word sporto. Nobody died connected to it. Nobody was enslaved or segregated in conjunction with it. Just stop,"" ""The Mo'Kelly Show"" host replied. ""You want the pain of the word, just none of the lynchings, disenfranchisement and hatred. Hush. "" ""Jeopardy!"" winner Ken Jennings also responded to the tweet: ""Don't worry, I'm Mormon like this guy so it's okay: I can call him a boomer with the hard 'r'. "" Another response tweet that shared a quote from stand-up comedian John Mulaney received more than 20,000 retweets and 80,000 likes: ""If you're comparing the badness of two words and you won't even say one of them, that's the worse word. "" Even Dictionary. com slammed Lonsberry's comparison.  ""Boomer is an informal noun referring to a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the U. S. between 1946 and 1965,"" the digital dictionary tweeted. ""The n-word is one of the most offensive words in the English language. "" Lonsberry is a New York native who hosts a conservative radio show, NewsRadio WHAM-AM, in Rochester.  This isn't the first time he's been under fire for controversial comments.  In 2003, he was suspended for comments that were interpreted as a racial slur against Democratic Mayor William Johnson Jr. , an African American who was running for local office.

| Jump to first hitWhen Chlöe Swarbrick discussed climate change on the floor of the New Zealand Parliament, she was sure to bring up her age as a young politician who will feel the effects of global warming.  ""How many world leaders for how many decades have seen and known what is coming but have decided that it is more politically expedient to keep it behind closed doors?"" the Green Party member asked.  ""My generation and the generations after me do not have that luxury. In the year 2050 I will be 56 years old, yet right now, the average age of this 52nd Parliament is 49 years old. "" As she spoke, a fellow member, seemingly taken aback by her comment on age, interjected: ""That's impossible.

"" The comment drew little reaction in the room, and Swarbrick continued to address the matter at hand, a bill to reshape New Zealand's climate change policies.  But the interaction is another example of how the increasingly popular internet phrase is becoming more mainstream.  ""OK, boomer"" has become a biting slogan younger generations have used on platforms like TikTok to express resentment toward older people, invoking the name of the baby boom generation.  'OK, boomer,' explained: Why are Gen Z and millennials calling out boomers on TikTok? The retort is a sort of response to the clichéd ""Kids these days,"" and it is often used by members of Generation Z and millennials to call on baby boomers and Generation X to stop generalizing them and to take action on world issues that would affect younger people.  The phrase captures a ""collective exhaustion,"" Swarbrick told New Zealand news outlet Stuff.  ""You cannot win a deeply polarized debate – facts don't matter,"" she told Stuff. ""It's better to acknowledge that perhaps energy is better spent elsewhere. "" The phrase is so new, captioning of Swarbrick's speech didn't even pick up on it, New Zealand Herald reporter Jason Walls noted.  The parliament's social media team apologized for the error and said the captions were updated. An official transcript of the hearing correctly records Swarbrick's comment.  However, some people – namely baby boomers – have apparently taken offense to the phrase. Conservative New York radio host Bob Lonsberry, 60, said, ""'boomer' is the n-word of ageism,"" in a since-deleted tweet Sunday. Lonsberry comments drew sharp criticism for equating a youth insult to racism.  Swarbrick also responded to any critics of her use of the phrase in a Facebook post.  ""Today I have learnt that responding succinctly and in perfect jest to somebody heckling you about *your age* as you speak about the impact of climate change on *your generation* with the literal title of their generation makes some people very mad.  ""So I guess millennials ruined humour. That, or we just need to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and abstain from avocados,"" she said. ""That’s the joke.

OPPORTUNITY, Mont. "" For a century, this tiny town has breathed beneath the long shadow of a colossal chimney. In fact, a mining behemoth created Opportunity specifically to prove it was safe to live in the path of the dark plume of smoke that billowed from the company's copper smelter.
The plant is long shuttered, but the big stack looms 585 feet tall, the largest free-standing masonry structure in the world. Studies long ago shattered the company's safety claims by linking high levels of arsenic and lead to serious health threats. These days, Opportunity is defined by its struggle to force powerful corporate and government interests to clean up the dangerous waste left behind.
After more than a decade of court battles, the Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear residents' case against the property's current owner. Theirs is more than just a David vs. Goliath confrontation "" a rural community of 700 against Arco, a subsidiary of the oil giant BP "" because of its potential for upending one of the nation's key environmental laws. 
Opportunity and its even smaller neighbor, Crackerville, want the justices to uphold a Montana Supreme Court ruling that found federal Superfund law does not override this state's constitutionally guaranteed right to a 'clean and healthful environment.' Arco, which appealed the decision, says it has already spent $470 million to reduce arsenic levels in the area. The towns say an additional $58 million is needed to lower those levels far more drastically.
The outcome of Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian holds significance well beyond this scenic valley in southwest Montana. Arco, as it is now known, argues that allowing individuals to sue in state court for greater cleanup than federal regulators require would nullify a key component of the Superfund program.
'The decision threatens the integrity of every future [Superfund] settlement EPA enters,' Arco has warned. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several industry groups agree, predicting 'chaos' for sites nationwide should Opportunity prevail.
 'It's a really long struggle,' said Serge Myers, who in the early 2000s helped spearhead a citizens' movement that led to the lawsuit. He is now a 74-year-old great-grandfather. 'We only have one lifetime, and the corporations have forever. We just want our yard to be clean and healthy for our kids.'
For Myers, the dormant smelter stack represents the best job he ever had. He worked nearly 17-years at the Anaconda Copper Mining Co. plant, which was the lifeblood of the city of Anaconda and outlying communities. He started there in the early 1960s and moved through a series of jobs until the company sold its properties to Arco in 1977.
'The money was good, we were all union members. By the time it ended, I had five weeks of vacation a year and good benefits,' Myers recalled. 'We had good jobs. We knew it was under smoky skies, but it was just part of the life, I guess. In smeltering cities, you just deal with it.'
Though the plant's operations had slowed, Arco still stunned the region when it shut down the entire operation in November 1980 and eliminated the 1,000 remaining jobs. Even so, the people of Opportunity couldn't have foreseen that the legal fight over toxic waste would outlive many of them. Myers guesses that a dozen of the nearly 100 residents who brought the lawsuit have died.
'I certainly thought we'd be treated better by the company than what we were,' he said.
Opportunity and Crackerville are part of the country's biggest Superfund complex, toxic relics from the century of copper mining. The ore lay under nearby Butte and was extracted through a massive maze of tunnels and later an open pit; Anaconda, 30-miles away with plentiful water, got the giant smelter that processed the ore. 
In the aftermath of the closure, as the region reeled economically and socially, residents began to piece together how much environmental damage the mega-mining had done.
Things got even worse around 2005, when bigger and much wealthier Missoula, 110 miles away, jumped to the front of the cleanup line as a dam with dangerous levels of toxic sludge was removed. Some 2.2 million cubic yards of waste were shipped back up the Clark Fork River and heaped on an already problematic dump site just outside Opportunity. 
Robin Saha, an environmental studies professor at the University of Montana, began working with residents as troubles started to pile up. Cancer-causing arsenic and other heavy metals had infiltrated the land and nearby streams, and dust storms "" their contents unknown "" plagued the town.

Myers had collected reams of evidence on the waste but had no experience in getting the attention of environmental groups or government. Saha and a team of graduate students helped Opportunity organize. 
'Usually we think of environmental justice involving communities of color being dumped on,' he said. 'Environmental justice is also about low-income and communities that lack the know-how and resources to stand up for themselves. That description fit Opportunity to a T.'
The core issue now in court is arsenic. In the early years, residents shared stories of mass sickness and death among livestock. In more recent times, they've worried over land where grass just wouldn't grow. Shaun Hoolahan, a petroleum engineer who grew up here but has lived all over the world, points to the benign tumors on his dog's belly as he describes how she used to lie on a bare spot of his yard. 
'That's got me wondering, what's really safe,' he said.
In their suit, residents are asking Arco to reduce arsenic levels in soil throughout the community to pre-contamination levels, around 10 times lower than the EPA-approved cleanup that brought them down to 250 parts per million. The company has pushed back against further remediation, saying 'respondents' soil-excavation plan risks spreading currently contained arsenic everywhere.' 
If the state court ruling is upheld, Arco contends, 'At any time, any landowner on any Superfund site could decide to shred EPA's cleanup plans and impose different, and potentially detrimental, multimillion-dollar cleanups. The entire community would be hostage to the whims of a small minority of dissatisfied landowners.'
Hoolahan, who moved home to care for elderly parents, worries about both the safety of the town and the stigma attached to living in a Superfund site. Opportunity lies in the shadow of the stunning Pintlar mountain range, within easy distance to pristine hiking trails, lakes and skiing, but it's never become a recreational hub or a place with strong property values. Hoolahan rubs his forefingers and thumb together "" the symbol of money "" as he talks about the reason.
'If this were Palm Springs, it would be a whole different matter,' he said.
People here are wary of the Supreme Court's involvement, in part because the attorney arguing Arco's case was a prominent supporter of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's nomination last year. While such connections are not unusual in Washington, it does add to a decades-long list of actions that have made Opportunity residents feel like the deck is stacked against them. 
No matter what the justices conclude, one of the residents' lawyers stresses that Opportunity's effort won't end. According to Justin Stalpes, there are other legal avenues yet to pursue.
'The people of Opportunity,' Stalpes noted, 'have been fighting the powers that be since the inception of the town.'

Now, political organizers are canvassing the state like it's autumn 2020. ""In Wisconsin, we're already in the general election while the rest of the country is thinking about the primary,"" says Democratic state chairman Ben Wikler.
Michigan and Pennsylvania are still vital. Every swing state is. But Wisconsin is a particularly challenging nut to crack, in part because of its uniquely divided electorate and recent political turmoil.

The state generates cozy tropes - cheese, Friday fish fries and Old-Fashioneds (with brandy, not whiskey), Wisconsin Nice and, yes, tailgating at Lambeau Field. But, as with many places, stereotypes crumble on closer inspection. 
The state is rural and urban, dairy farmer and union, and almost equally split between Democrats and Republicans. It elected progressive Tammy Baldwin, the first senator to identify as gay, and avid Trumper Ron Johnson. Despite a state county map that was a blue quilt in 2008 and predominantly Badger red in 2016, ""we've been purple all along,"" says Charles Franklin, director of the state's leading Marquette Law School Poll.
Long a cornerstone of the Midwest's mighty Blue Wall, Wisconsin produced a troika of recent Republican national figures: former RNC chair and Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, former House speaker Paul Ryan and, most divisively, former two-time governor and two-month presidential candidate Scott Walker, who survived a 2012 recall vote.
As Dan Kaufman writes in his book ""The Fall of Wisconsin,"" the GOP's control of the capital over the past decade transformed the state ""from a widely admired 'laboratory of democracy' to a testing ground for national conservatives bent on remaking America.""
All these dualities make for antacid-inducing close elections, as with the recent races for governor (won by Democrat Tony Evers) and state Supreme Court (conservative-backed Brian Hagedorn). In three of the past five presidential contests, Wisconsin was determined by less than one percentage point. Winning the state requires an intense ground game, many of its 72 counties decided by fewer ballots than the number to clinch a high school election.
Says Baldwin, who secured reelection last year by 11 percentage points, an exceptional mandate for recent state contests, ""Taking a cookie-cutter approach won't work.""
Walker says that Wisconsinites ""respond to authentic candidates."" He says that of the three leading Democratic candidates, he's most concerned about Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic nomination. ""Like Trump, people believe Bernie is fighting for them. His ideas are the most extreme, but he's authentic. He doesn't hide on the substance.""
Congeniality is a matter of pride. There are few places where people speak more about their shared humility. Yet, in the past decade, politics has become a blood sport.
Resentment can be heard across the state. Milwaukee residents and farmers alike are tired of being treated like an afterthought. Republicans are critical of public employees and union members. Those public employees and union members feel battered.
""It's hard to have a polite conversation,"" says Hans Breitenmoser Jr., a dairy farmer in Merrill. ""Wisconsin is just as polarized as other places in the country.""




It's no accident that Democrats selected Milwaukee to host their quadrennial national confab next summer. It's the Mea Culpa Convention. Trump has returned regularly as president, though his love affair with Harley-Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has soured.
During the campaign, millions of dollars are projected to flood into Wisconsin from the parties, PACs, get-out-the-vote efforts, donors in deep-blue states, big money, dark money, $5 checks.
""No one is going to ignore Wisconsin,"" Wikler says. ""You have to come here to win the presidency. As goes Wisconsin, so goes the nation."" (Take that, Ohio.)
His counterpart, Republican state chair Andrew Hitt, agrees: ""We are going to have visits from the president and his surrogates, and more resources than you've ever seen.""
To Republicans, winning Wisconsin is a referendum, to show that 2016 wasn't an aberration.
To Democrats, the campaign is a reclamation project, to prove that Wisconsin remains a bastion of liberal politics.
In Waukesha County, the GOP held a ""week of action"" - in July. The first weekend of November, a brigade of Democratic volunteers knocked on more than 50,000 doors across the state (though not during the sacred Packers game).
The parties here have to navigate a thicket of constituencies. Wisconsin is a union state where unions have been decimated, most notably by Act 10, the 2011 Walker-led initiative that eliminated the union rights of most public workers. Mention Act 10 in many regions and prepare to clear the room. Green Bay teacher Grace Kubeny says: ""My mom dated a guy for 20 years and they're done because of Scott Walker. I hate Scott Walker more than I hate Trump.""
The state is more than 80 percent white. Milwaukee, by far its largest city, is nearly 60 percent black and Hispanic. The metro region, among the nation's most segregated, is home to the predominantly white suburban WOW counties - Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington - that are the linchpin to Republican victory.
Milwaukee and Madison can help deliver Wisconsin to Democrats, as they did twice for Barack Obama - but only if residents turn out. In 2016, this didn't happen in Milwaukee, largely because of a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton and a Republican-sponsored voter ID law that proved a challenge for students, voters of color, the elderly and the economically disadvantaged.
Wisconsin boasts enviable turnout among eligible voters - 69.5 percent in 2016, far better than the 59.2 percent participation nationwide. But it can be a challenge to accurately poll. Clinton led in the pre-election 2016 surveys. Wisconsin has Election Day registration and doesn't collect registered-voter data on gender, race or party affiliation. About 40 percent of the electorate identifies as independent, according to the Marquette poll. In 2016, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson each garnered more votes than the number separating Trump and Clinton.
""Independent"" is often polite Wisconsinese for ""none of your business."" In interviews with three dozen voters, residents identified as ""conservative"" or ""progressive"" and listed key issues rather than offering party affiliation.
""Wisconsin is perhaps tired of the Democrat-versus-Republican label,"" Baldwin says. 
A University of Wisconsin instructor in Madison, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of backlash for speaking about politics as a public employee, said that recent political squabbles have damaged the state's conviviality. ""There is fatigue from all the chaos. Norms have been broken. Families are not speaking to each other. Friends are not speaking to each other.""



""The Silent Majority Stands With Trump"" read signs affixed to the windows of a former Waukesha storage facility in a suburban strip mall, the home of local Republican operations in the party's most vote-rich county. The initial three words - minted by Richard Nixon a half-century ago this week - are printed in sloping pink cursive.
""Republicans and Midwesterners tend to be pretty humble,"" says Waukesha County GOP chair Terry Dittrich, sitting in the operation's Reagan Room, filled with portraits of the former president. ""They keep their opinions to themselves.""
Well, not supporters at Trump's rallies in Green Bay and Eau Claire. But many voters stick to the Wisconsin Nice approach, knowing that family and neighbors may have differing views.
The Silent Majority signs' target audience is clear: Female Republican voters who support the president's policies but not his personal behavior. ""Women's issues are big issues for us,"" Dittrich says. ""Many women voters are willing to overlook some of what might be considered Trump's shortcomings."" So, the local office is courting them early. The next day, the facility plays host to 68 female Trump supporters to watch a three-hour Democratic debate.
 Three years ago, Trump notably underperformed here, collecting 20,000 fewer votes than Romney-Ryan in 2012. (He received a few thousand fewer statewide.) The Trump state director for strategic initiatives is already working out of the office, trying to win those votes back.
In solid-blue Madison, NextGen hosts a debate watch party in a narrow University Avenue storefront decorated like a teen bedroom, walls plastered with cutout images of engaged young people and Sharpied with motivational scribblings. There's pizza, seltzer and cookies, courtesy of billionaire and now presidential candidate Tom Steyer, who pumped $30 million into 10 states to engage young people, before he chose to run for president. NextGen's state staff of 13 has the goal to get thousands of young people to sign pledge-to-vote cards.
On the north side of Milwaukee, BLOC - Black Leaders Organizing for Communities - has trained 16 paid civic ambassadors to canvas neighborhoods. ""We're making sure that people are engaged and know why elections are important,"" Executive Director Angela Lang says of the nonpartisan group.
BLOC has attracted outsize attention, with visits from candidates Julián Castro, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar long before the state's April 7 primary and a donation from Alyssa Milano's get-out-the-vote fund, among others. Next year, the group plans to more than double its budget and deploy a staff of 100. Says ambassador Keviea Guiden, ""It's the black votes that matter in this election.""
In Paoli, outside Madison, Democratic cheesemaker Anna Landmark is engaging rural liberals who feel overlooked and is trying to get candidates to pay more attention to their issues. ""There's a huge enthusiasm gap for progressive communities, as well as a news desert for many of these areas,"" so candidates can't reach rural constituents, she says at her Landmark Creamery. ""People are nervous about talking to their neighbors. Community life has faded.""
To address those issues, the Eau Claire County Democratic Party runs a weekly Thursday-morning coffee klatch to keep voters involved, as well as phone banks two nights a week. The pressure is on in Sauk County, northwest of Madison, a bellwether after correctly predicting Wisconsin's electoral winner in nine of the past 10 presidential elections. With turnout of 72 percent, Trump won Sauk County by 109 votes. 
""When did we start working on the election? We haven't stopped,"" says Tammy Wood, county Democratic chair. The goal is to canvas all 30,000 voters.
Tom Breneman, an Eau Claire brewmaster and former dentist, is a libertarian - part of the 3.6 percent of the state's electorate who supported Gary Johnson in 2016. He's against abortion, which rules out a Democrat, but is no fan of the president or his tariffs: ""It's like a car wreck. It's crazy that he's president. I'm much more interested in local politics."" He doesn't say who he's going to vote for next November but adds, ""I'll probably hold my nose.""
What are Wisconsinites' issues? Health care, definitely. Tariffs on farming and industry, certainly. To Ed Gorell, a former family farmer who is now a milk hauler in Eleva, it's the nation's farm policies, which subsidize corporate consolidation, creating an oversupply that slashes milk prices: ""They basically destroyed my business."" At BLOC in Milwaukee, it's jobs, economic investment, safer communities, schools. Younger voters in Madison? Climate change, gun violence, economic opportunity. Breitenmoser, the dairy farmer from Merrill, is enraged by gerrymandering. At the Packers game, Angela Menehan of Albany says: ""Quit worrying about other countries. We need to take care of homeless people.""
Basically, everything.
Many local political operatives declare their region the key to victory. ""The battle for Wisconsin won't be won simply in Madison and Milwaukee, Waukesha, Green Bay, Racine and Eau Claire,"" Baldwin says, before listing most of the state's eight congressional districts.
Basically, everywhere.
The campaign to claim this state will be long, fierce and punitively expensive.

""I don't know how, following 2016, you could go into this feeling confident at all,"" says Brian Westrate, treasurer of the state GOP. ""Wisconsin could go either way. Anyone who claims different is lying to themselves.""

A mere three hours until kickoff and the Lambeau Field parking lot is a wonderland of bay green and cheese yellow, the weekly Packernalia thronged with truck-bed bars offering potent libations and grills bursting with plump brats and steaks.

This oasis of raucous unity belies the political divide that has made Wisconsin the sizzling center of the 2020 presidential race. A year before the election, many pundits and pollsters have declared that the state could be the tippiest of tipping points - and residents are elated.
All that scrutiny, all that face time, all that glorious lucre targeted on its prized 10 electoral votes.
""All this attention, it's going to be fun,"" says towering Frozen Tundra Man, a.k.a. Jeff Kahlow of Fond du Lac, swathed in grass and foam this Monday night in October, his face daubed with ersatz icicles, crowned with a likeness of Lambeau.
Three years ago, Wisconsin was projected to be a sure thing for Hillary Clinton. As any Wisconsinite can tell you, once Clinton secured the nomination, she didn't campaign here for a single second. Ads didn't air until days before the election.
Donald Trump made constant visits, two to this football-besotted city. He clutched the state by a margin of 22,748 votes, the first Republican to win since Ronald Reagan in 1984. When many TV networks finally called Wisconsin for Trump, that clinched the election.

This year it became 'OK' to be ageist. It became acceptable to digitally flick off your elders or young'uns on social media, to respond 'OK boomer' or 'OK millennial,' when, in truth, the people being addressed were often far from okay.

It was the year when it wasn't enough to be precociously talented if you didn't possess the wisdom of the ages. Billie Eilish, who turned all of 18 last week, admitted to Jimmy Kimmel that she didn't know who Van Halen is, and was trolled mercilessly on social media. Hey, she admitted it! When do young folks admit not knowing something when they have a Googleapedia in their hand? No, she's ignorant, even if 'Jump' was released almost two decades before her birth. 

While many people "" though certainly not all "" try to be more sensitive about race, orientation and heritage, ageist tropes ran rampant. 'Age-based prejudice is the last acceptable form of prejudice,' says New York University's Michael North, who studies ageism in the workplace. 'People are making age-based generalizations and stereotypes that you wouldn't be able to get away with about race or background. Insert some sort of racial or ethnic group, or 'OK Woman,' and it wouldn't go over too well.'
People are getting away with it. This year, the baby boom was blamed for almost everything: the fate of the planet, Congress, college debt, plastic straws, the ending of 'Game of Thrones.' An entire generation was perceived to be operating as a giant monolith, mind-melded in its intention to make young people miserable for the rest of their long lives. Never mind that old people were once young, struggling, loaded with debt, facing a lousy job market, expensive housing, inflation. (Yes, there was something called inflation. It had to be whipped. Ask your parents.)
And, guess what, millennials? You are acquiring property. So, you know, patience.
The sewer of mockery flowed both ways, upstream and down. It was funny, except when it wasn't. If young folk derided the Olds for leaving an environmental and fiscal mess, the baby boom was happy to sling verbal mud in their direction.
After 'OK boomer' erupted, AARP senior vice president and editorial director Myrna Blyth said in an interview with Axios, 'Okay, millennials, but we're the people that actually have the money.' (AARP long stood for American Association of Retired Persons, but now a growing number of older Americans can't or won't retire.)
 The large field of presidential contenders, ranging from septuagenarians (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Donald Trump) to millennials (Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard), has launched barbs about age, experience and suitability. Buttigieg "" his campaign moniker, 'Mayor Pete,' buffing his youth "" called for 'generational change.' 
To many voters, Buttigieg's rallying cry was about darned time. If Finland can select a 34-year-old leader, why are we stuck with grandparents? To author and anti-ageism activist Ashton Applewhite, 'generational change' was a punch. 'I see it as actual hate speech,' she says. 'We don't need 'generational change.' We need old and young to work together.' 
In the most recent debate, Sen.-Amy Klobuchar zinged Buttigieg, complete with finger wag, saying he had 'mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage.'

Environmental activist Greta Thunberg, 16, was anointed Time's Person of the Year "" 'The Power of Youth' declares the cover. Thunberg, in her September United Nations climate summit address, squarely put responsibility on earlier generations: 'You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.' After Time's selection, some pundits went nuclear over why, among others, Nancy Pelosi, 79, hadn't been chosen.
Generational conflict has been around since adolescents perfected the eye roll. But children were long instructed to respect age and refrain from talking back, no matter how ludicrous their elders' behavior. The practice held until the outsize, outspoken and oxygen-sucking baby boom reached adolescence and early adulthood.
More than half a century ago, young people sang of generational disdain ('I hope I die before I get old') and preached it ('Don't trust anyone over 30') until they stopped because the treacherous enemy had become them. In 1969, 'ageism' literally became a thing, coined by psychiatrist and gerontologist Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging.
What distinguishes these latest ageist salvos are their intensity and frequency. It's an intergenerational quipping contest, fueled by the rapid, reductionist and unrestrictive nature of social media, which makes it far too easy to cast verbal stones. 'Social media amplifies previously latent sentiment,' North says.
'My generation grew up having the Internet as a big part of our life,' says Shannon O'Connor, 19, a student at Montclair State University in New Jersey, who was resourceful enough to transform 'OK boomer' into an apparel line. 'Newer generations aren't afraid to speak up about what is upsetting them. The Internet is where you dump your frustrations.'
Age groups tend to segregate on distinct platforms, creating echo chambers of consensus. Gen Z and millennials prefer Instagram, YouTube and TikTok "" the latter is where 'OK boomer' first gained momentum "" while their parents and grandparents favor Facebook.
As with any bias, it became common to castigate an entire group for the behavior of an individual. Why target one person "" say, Trump or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "" when you could blame millions? Consequently, the dire state of the planet was pinned on one generation, even lifelong environmentalists, while another was chided for insolence and ignorance.
'These comments may be heartfelt, but there's very little substance. It obscures the complexity of generational difference,' says Jay Sokolovsky, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Florida at St.-Petersburg. 'We need to go beyond the simplistic. It's a form of blaming a generation for the problems we're having in society.'
Not everyone agrees. 'I think 'OK boomer' is funny. Newer generations aren't afraid to speak up,' says Malick Mercier, 20, a self-described 'next-gen storyteller' and Ithaca College sophomore. 'Older people tell us we're always on our phone. I feel like I'm on my voice, talking about things that matter to me.' He says that generalizations can hold true. 'If boomers had actually listened to our generation,' Mercier says, 'instead of explaining everything to us, I'm not sure 'OK boomer' would have happened.'

An unprecedented six generations, as defined by the Pew Research Center, coexist at one time: silent (born 1928-1945), boomers (1946-1964), Gen X (1965-1980), millennials (1981-1996), Gen Z (1997-2012), and To Be Named Later (tykes born after 2012, and good luck plucking a new letter). The baby boom, named for the unprecedented spike in births "" 76 million "" after World War II, is the only group officially designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.
For centuries, geriatrician Louise Aronson says, civilization was divided into three stages as they related to family, not society: childhood, adulthood and what she deems elderhood, the title of her latest book.
'Human instinct is to categorize people. That part isn't new,' Aronson says. 'What's new is making it so generational.'
 The moment a group is identified and named, people want to assign it characteristics, whether they're shared or not. The names themselves are often folly. Is the silent generation, also dubbed 'the greatest generation' by Tom Brokaw's 1998 book on the topic, universally silent or singularly great?
'It's not always clear where the names come from and who is making these definitions,' North says. 'These groups seem to come about in random waves.' Historically, a generation spanned 20 to 30 years. Counterintuitively, at a time when people are waiting longer to have children, they've contracted to 15.
'Age is the only universal social category. Unlike race, gender, socioeconomic status, age has this inevitability, assuming you live long enough,' North says. 'It's this paradox, given that we're all in this together, that I'm going to be there one day, and we're making these comments.'
Any day now, boomers won't be blamed for everything that is not okay. This is the year "" can you feel it? "" that, according to Pew's analysis of census projections, millennials are scheduled to surpass the baby boom in sheer size, 73 million to 72 million, because of, well, death. By 2028, Gen X is also projected to be larger than the baby boom, so we'll probably start blaming them.
In the meantime, perhaps the generations need to be kinder to each other. 'Maybe you shouldn't be degrading us,' O'Connor says. She found an enterprise, selling more than 6,000 pieces of 'OK-boomer' merch since mid-October, including shirts and sweats that repeat the phrase seven times, punctuated with 'Have a terrible day.' Truly, she means no harm. 
'It's a lighthearted joke. We all can be hurt by things,' O'Connor says. 'In the end, we're all human. We're all the same in the end. We can't really hold an entire generation to the behavior of a few.' And the 'OK boomer' sales help pay her tuition.

PHOTO: James Yang
As 2019 ends, various dictionary publishers are choosing their ""Word of the Year,"" a term they believe has surged the most in usage and importance. The originator of this practice, the
American Dialect Society
, makes its choice on Jan. 3, and this time the gathering of scholars will also pick a ""Word of the Decade.""
Full disclosure: As chair of the society's New Words Committee, I'll be overseeing the selections. Earlier this week, I visited my son's eighth-grade class at his Jersey City middle school to give a talk about the process, and I asked the students what their nomination would be for 2019. Several piped up with ""boomer"" and ""OK boomer.""
My
Generation Z
audience then proceeded to break down the significance of an epithet that has indeed made a big impact over the past year. For millennials and especially post-millennials, ""OK boomer"" has become a sly linguistic weapon of intergenerational warfare.
In its current use as a put-down, ""boomer"" has strayed from its original meaning referring to members of the baby boom generation born after World War II—and long known, partly thanks to their outsize numbers, as powerful trendsetters for the culture as a whole. Members of the postwar generation began to be called ""baby boomers""
as early as 1963
and simply ""boomers""
by 1974
.
But in Generation Z parlance, ""boomer"" can be applied to anyone older who has a condescending or out-of-touch attitude toward young people and their concerns. As my Gen Z son puts it, ""It's not an age group—it's a mind-set."" (Confusion over what exactly ""boomer"" means now is reflected in ""what is a boomer"" being one of
Google's top searches
in 2019.)
The full phrase ""OK boomer"" has been embraced as a handy retort to mock anyone stodgily complaining about kids today, with the kids themselves spreading the expression in viral fashion on video-sharing platforms like TikTok. The phrase was mostly percolating under the radar until it garnered major media attention in late October, in widely shared articles
from NBC News
and the New York Times
.
Pretty soon ""OK boomer"" was everywhere, and the backlash from the older side of the generational divide was swift. Conservative radio host Bob Lonsberry, in a now-deleted tweet, went so far as to
declare
that ""boomer"" is now ""the n-word of ageism."" Myrna Blyth, editorial director of AARP Media,
told Axios
, ""OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money."" Others have tried out ""
OK zoomer
"" as a comeback to the comeback, using ""zoomer"" as a snarky label for Generation Z.
The phrase next made international news: Chlöe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of New Zealand's Parliament,
became an online sensation
when she used ""OK boomer"" to respond to heckling of a climate-change speech she was giving. In U.S. politics, meanwhile, targets of the jibe have included 77-year-old former vice president Joe Biden (born before the baby boom generation, whose members now range from 55 to 73). As I mentioned
in a previous column
, one Iowa voter reacting to Mr. Biden's old-fashioned campaign slogan ""No Malarkey"" told Politico, ""I'm afraid he's going to be disregarded as, 'OK boomer.'""
""Boomer"" talk has even crossed linguistic boundaries. This week, Van Dale, a dictionary publisher in the Netherlands, announced ""boomer"" as the
Dutch Word of the Year
after an online vote of more than 17,000 people.
In New Zealand
, thanks to Ms. Swarbrick, ""OK boomer"" topped a ""Word of the Year"" poll held by media commentator Russell Brown. Will the American Dialect Society similarly honor ""OK boomer""? If it loses out, I can guess what the terse response from those eighth-graders is going to be.

Best books on retirement this year include new titles by Bill Bryson, Gail Collins and Louise Aronson. PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal
Whatever your age, this year's book selections offer myriad ways to define—and redefine—what healthy aging means to you. You'll find helpful advice and insights for achieving health and well-being in mind, body and bank account, and perhaps inspirations for your next adventure.
Your Complete Guide to a Successful & Secure Retirement
By Larry E. Swedroe and Kevin Grogan. Foreword by Wade D. Pfau. Harriman House.
Veteran investment and personal-finance experts Larry E. Swedroe and Kevin Grogan answer essential questions you probably didn't even know to ask in this authoritative yet accessible handbook.
They start with the risks posed by what they dub ""the four horsemen of the retirement apocalypse"": stock valuations at historic highs, bond yields at historic lows, increasing longevity, and its mate, the cost of long-term care. These four horsemen, the authors point out, can look particularly threatening to those who make such common mistakes as underestimating how much money they'll need in retirement and overestimating how long they'll continue to work. The authors offer a variety of investment strategies based on different needs, goals, values, interests (including volunteerism and philanthropy), physical health and bucket lists. They walk readers through the intricacies of Social Security, Medicare, health savings accounts, health-care plans, IRAs, annuities and insurance. And to conclude, they give sage advice on estate planning, including difficult family discussions that can help to prevent surprises and friction later, and how to protect both yourself and those you love against the threat of elder financial abuse.
Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life
By Louise Aronson. Bloomsbury.
There is a frustrating paradox at the heart of Louise Aronson's sometimes bracing, always compassionate treatise, based on 25 years of clinical practice as a geriatrician: The U.S. health-care system has not kept pace with the changing needs of an aging population that is now living longer precisely because of the availability of ever more advanced medical treatments. For instance, Dr. Aronson points out that although about 40% of all hospital patients are seniors, medical-school students today receive relatively little training focused specifically on treating and caring for these patients. As a result, she writes, doctors might neglect such issues as how an aging, more vulnerable immune system can affect the course of a disease; and how coexisting medical conditions can lead to dangerous drug interactions when specialists don't consult each other. She advocates for the return of old-fashioned house calls and designs of medical buildings that are ""silver"" friendly. Most of all, she urges everyone to push back against outmoded assumptions about aging that can blind us from seeing the resilient individual within an aging, perhaps ailing body.
The Body: A Guide for Occupants
By Bill Bryson. Doubleday.
Few writers combine wit with erudition as nimbly as Bill Bryson. In his latest book, he explores terrains intimate and mysterious. ""We pass our existence within this warm wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted,"" he writes. Most of us lack the foggiest idea how or why our various body parts do their jobs so seamlessly—and we are left baffled when they fail us. Enter Mr. Bryson with his engaging survey of how we're put together. He draws on extensive research, interviews and medical-case histories, as well as his own wry humor and sense of wonder. Each chapter reads like a portrait of a different physical feature or attribute, often including medical and scientific discoveries that have led to our current understanding. There are striking observations, as well, such as the doctor who points to a shaving of skin no more than a millimeter thick and notes, ""That's all race is—a sliver of epidermis."" Ultimately, Mr. Bryson encourages us to cherish our bodies. After all, life is uncertain, except for this: ""In a few tens of years at most you will close your eyes forever and cease to move at all. So it might not be a bad idea to take advantage of movement, for health and pleasure, while you still can.""
Uncharted
By Kim Brown Seely. Sasquatch Books.
The best adventure stories track journeys that are both physical and psychological, as in this autobiographical tale from travel writer Kim Brown Seely. Anxiety looms for many married couples, as, one by one, the children leave the nest. As their youngest son prepares to leave home for college, Ms. Seely and her husband, Jeff, approach their transition to an empty nest with trepidation. What to do? Though neither knows much about sailing, they impulsively buy a 54-foot sailboat in need of repair. Their plan, Ms. Seely writes: Sail north, alone, from their home near Seattle to a remote island off British Columbia in search of the ""spirit bear,"" a rare, pale-colored relative of the black bear. Ms. Seely captures the action and nature encountered on the couple's journey in lyrical prose and descriptions. As they navigate their way through fiords and rough waters and feel the sting of cold air, they also find a new way to envision their future together.
No Stopping Us Now: The Adventures of Older Women in American History
By Gail Collins. Little, Brown.
In her briskly paced, highly entertaining social history of older women in America, journalist Gail Collins deftly chronicles the changing stereotypes and attitudes toward women of a certain age alongside stories of many women who challenged those assumptions.

Older Workers Have a Big Secret Their Age

The age at which a woman was considered in or past her prime has been subject to debate since Colonial times, Ms. Collins shows. As a promoter of emigration to New England wrote in the 17th century, the dearth of females made women prime marriage candidates ""if they be but Civil, and under 50 years of age."" In 1857, suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, after the birth of her sixth child, wrote to her friend and fellow suffragette Susan B. Anthony, ""We shall not be in our prime before fifty, and after that we shall be good for twenty years at least."" She was 40 at the time. Ms. Collins peppers her survey with anecdotes about women in literature and the arts, entertainment, medicine, politics, social activism, popular culture, business and other fields. With age boundaries continually being pushed forward, she looks to the future with cautious optimism. Such an attitude, she maintains, ""isn't self-deluding if you acknowledge right off the bat that this one may involve hip replacements.""
Wanderlust: A Traveler's Guide to the Globe
By Philippe Gloaguen. Moon Travel Guides.
If the travel bug hasn't bit you yet, prepare for it as you browse this practical and attractively illustrated volume. Philippe Gloaguen suggests numerous itineraries for all tastes, activities and budgets. Locations and ideas for travel are grouped by themes. Nature lovers can read about national parks and other natural phenomena in the U.S., Argentina, Costa Rica, Kenya, France, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia and elsewhere. There are off-the-beaten-track suggestions as well: stargazing observation points for astronomy buffs, for instance, and best bets for glimpsing the aurora borealis. For those who favor the bright lights and buzz of urban areas, there is a section that profiles 50 must-see cities of the world, with tips on not-to-be missed dining, street art and quirky neighborhoods. Another section points out destinations for their cultural, spiritual, artistic and historical significance. While armchair adventurers will appreciate the photography, graphics and research this book offers, there is also an emphasis on activities, with specific suggestions about cruises and hiking, culinary and wine trails, festivals, carnivals and other celebrations.

Patti Temple Rocks, 60, says at her new job, 'They wanted me for my experience, which makes them the exception.' PHOTO: Lucy Hewett for The Wall Street Journal
Peppy Dubno worked for 23 years for a large financial-services company in New York. And during that time, she didn't tell anybody her age.
Ms. Dubno, who retired last year at 70 as a vice president specializing in data and information architecture, didn't talk about when she went to college or other life events that might reveal her age. She didn't correct colleagues who thought she was far younger, because of her proficiency in technology and because she's fit and very youthful looking with shoulder-length light brown hair.
She knew she was highly regarded by her bosses and colleagues. But she worried about fitting in to a workplace where many employees are in their twenties and managers two or three decades younger than her. ""I didn't want anyone to think of me as their parents' age,"" she says.
Employees in their 50s, 60s and 70s, though outnumbered in the workforce by millennials, are the only group whose labor-force participation rates are growing. Yet they are the least visible in offices, retail outlets and other workplaces. That is because many conceal their ages. Worried they'll be avoided or rejected by younger managers and co-workers, they often go to great lengths to try to appear younger—by doing such things as getting cosmetic surgery, shortening their work histories on social-media accounts and in conversations, not citing past accomplishments and not displaying photographs of their grandchildren.
""Older employees are in the closet today in much the same way gay employees used to be,"" says Ruth Finkelstein, director of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College. ""There's pressure to pretend not to be aging in order to succeed while aging—and employers who don't celebrate their contributions or give them opportunities for new assignments and promotions as they do young talent are complicit in this deception.""
Internalized ageism
Such internalized ageism is rampant, with many baby boomers dreading being called ""old,"" fearing it will undermine their ability to be accepted and compete in workplaces where youth is prized. They worry they'll be stereotyped as unable to learn new things or understand technology, or they'll be considered slow, old-fashioned, too costly and likely to become ill—and subsequently denied promotions and raises or laid off.
Their fears aren't unfounded. About 56% of U.S. workers who are 50 or older are pushed out of jobs before they plan to retire, and only one in 10 who find new work ever again earn as much, according to a recent
study
by Urban Institute economist Richard Johnson. Although it is illegal for employers to discriminate against workers, it is difficult to prove; employees must show they lost a job or didn't get an assignment solely because of their age.
For older employees who have lost a job, hiding their age seems especially important as they search for new employment. 





Michael Snizek PHOTO: Bryan Anselm for The Wall Street Journal
Michael Snizek, a 63-year-old financial-services-products manager, was among 15 employees laid off in 2017. Earlier in his career he worked at such companies as Merrill Lynch and UBS Financial Services, he has learned that disclosing his college graduation date on a job interview ""is a disqualifier,"" as is mentioning jobs that go back more than 15 or 20 years.
""I've never felt better in my life, plus now that my kids are grown, I have more time to jump on a plane and be away from home for long stretches of time,"" says Mr. Snizek, who last year made 15 trips to Copenhagen as a consultant to a company. ""Too many employers think that if you're older, you'll never be able to stay awake after 7 p.m.,"" says Mr. Snizek, who wants to work for five to 10 more years.
As he looks for new employment, he has adopted a youthful image. He carries a backpack instead of a briefcase, has discarded his old leather shoes for a trendier, two-tone pair of Allbirds, and asks his daughter what podcasts and Netflix shows she and her friends like most so he can converse easily with young managers.
Feeling devalued
Patti Temple Rocks knows how tough it can be for older workers. Now 60, she was moved from an executive position at a Chicago-based communications company last year to a less influential job, despite having received strong performance reviews, she says. ""I felt devalued when I least expected it—when I felt I was at the height of my skills and knowledge,"" says Ms. Rocks. When she told her boss she wasn't happy with her new position, he asked, ""How long do you plan on working anyway?"" she says. (Ms. Rocks's ex-company declines to comment on her tenure.) She left the company, wrote ""I'm Not Done,"" a book about ageism in the workplace, and now is working as chief client officer at ICF Next in Chicago, a unit of ICF International.
""They wanted me for my experience, which makes them the exception,"" she says.

Best Books of the Year About Aging and Retirement

Concealing one's age is an understandable tactic, but it is stressful and takes a psychological toll. ""If you're in hiding, you're never fully present and you're worried about being found out,"" says Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University who has studied and written about aging, decision making and mindfulness.
Employees who are afraid to talk honestly about themselves and the knowledge they have accumulated over long careers are apt to lose confidence and withdraw, says Ms. Langer, 72. This, in turn, can result in them being overlooked and excluded by bosses and colleagues from strategy meetings or social gatherings—precisely what they need to avoid happening if they want to keep working.
Employers go along with the secrecy by avoiding conversations about employees' ages and tenure. They worry that if they inquire about or mention anyone's age, they'll be accused of discrimination. Just 8% of CEOs
surveyed
by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2015 said their diversity and inclusion strategies included a conversation about age.
""There hasn't yet been a groundswell of consciousness-raising about age the way there is about gender, race and sexual preference,"" says Kathleen Christensen, director of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's working longer project, which researches older Americans' employment patterns.
Looking ahead
This is likely to change as the labor force gets grayer and employers increasingly need to use older employees. About 27% of 65- to 74-year-olds had full- or part-time jobs in 2016, and by 2026, 30% are expected to be employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2030, Americans who are 65 and older will outnumber those 18 and younger.
""The demographics will help older employees come out—if only because there will be so many of them—and force companies to better leverage their experience,"" says Joe Casey, an executive coach at Retirement Wisdom in Princeton, N.J., and a former human-resources manager at Merrill Lynch.
For now, though, many older employees think they are prudent to conceal their ages. When a 73-year-old program director at a nonprofit in New York overheard her millennial colleagues talking about the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock music festival, she bit her tongue and restrained herself from telling them she'd been there. She regularly gets Botox injections to smooth wrinkles and steps away from her office cubicle when she needs to make a doctor's appointment, because she doesn't want to be overheard providing her date of birth. Although her boss has encouraged her to keep working, she worries younger colleagues who learn her age will complain that she should vacate her position for one of them to fill.
Older employees need a ""come-out-about-age"" campaign, says Ms. Finkelstein of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging, who tells everyone she works with and meets through her job that she's 65. ""Staying in the closet and going through contortions to try to appear younger makes it harder to change the belief that you can't be old and still working effectively,"" she says.

Of the many health issues that come with aging, one of the most vexing is also among the hardest to talk about, even with a doctor: a troublesome bladder.
Now, researchers and doctors are mounting new efforts to erase the stigma, inform patients about the best treatment options -- and prevent problems from starting in the first place by promoting better bladder health.
One-third of Americans 40 and older report suffering from urinary incontinence -- the accidental leakage of urine -- at least ""sometimes,"" according to the nonprofit Urology Care Foundation. By interfering with daily life, incontinence can cause emotional, psychological and social distress. It occurs twice as often in women, but also affects 1 in 4 men.
Yet many sufferers wait years before seeking care, if they seek it at all. Untreated, incontinence contributes to misery in old age, and is associated with falls and fractures, sleep problems, depression and urinary-tract infections.
""Every day, we see patients who say, 'I'm too embarrassed to talk about this,' and they are always shocked when we tell them how common it is,"" says Donna Mazloomdoost, program director of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which sponsored a new study that aims to improve how women are counseled and treated.
One of the most bothersome types of urinary incontinence is urgency incontinence, a symptom of overactive bladder, which happens when the bladder muscle spontaneously contracts, leading to a sudden and strong urge to urinate even if the bladder isn't full. Another type, stress incontinence, occurs when weak support around the urethra lets urine escape. This can happen during exercise, walking, lifting or even after a sneeze, cough or laugh.
For women, incontinence issues can start after pregnancy or chronic conditions that weaken pelvic muscles and worsen over time. High-impact sports and vigorous activities are associated with stress incontinence in girls and women in reproductive years, and menopause can bring on overactive bladder and incontinence. A 2018 poll conducted by the University of Michigan found nearly half of women over 50 experienced moderate to severe incontinence but two-thirds hadn't talked to their doctor about it.
Stress incontinence is less common in men. But overactive bladder is more likely in men with prostate problems including prostatitis, a painful inflammation of the prostate gland, and benign prostate hyperplasia, an enlargement of the gland. Incontinence is a common side effect of radiation and surgery for prostate cancer, including overflow incontinence, which may result in a constant drip.
For both sexes, incontinence can result from diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and lifestyle habits that directly affect the bladder. Researchers are also studying the role of the urobiome -- communities of bacteria that live in the urinary tract and are unique to each person. Imbalances in the urobiome can be linked to common bladder issues and might help predict which patients will respond to specific treatments, says Linda Brubaker, a urogynecologist at UC San Diego Health, part of the University of California.
Often, lifestyle changes such as losing weight and quitting smoking can help stave off or ease bladder problems. Excess weight weakens pelvic-floor muscles, while smoking causes coughing that can also lead to bladder leaks.
""Most people can be helped by using simple common sense,"" says Dr. Brubaker. ""Treat your bladder well by filling it in a kind way and then emptying it regularly,"" she advises. Pelvic-floor strengthening using a technique known as Kegel exercises can strengthen muscles that control the bladder, and behavioral techniques such as suppressing the urge to run to the bathroom can help regain control over the bladder.
Treatment for urgency incontinence may begin with prescriptions for behavioral and exercise techniques and medications. Stress incontinence can also be treated with exercise, but when symptoms don't improve in women, an outpatient surgical procedure to place a thin strip of mesh under the urethra, known as a sling, is commonly used to prevent leaks.
As many as half of women with incontinence have both urgency and stress incontinence, a combination that is especially tough to manage. Standard treatment guidelines suggest that surgery may worsen the urgency component, so doctors might not offer it as an option early on. However, a study co-authored by Dr. Mazloomdoost and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association challenged that approach, finding that it may unnecessarily delay surgery that can help women with mixed urinary incontinence.
For men with urinary problems due to enlarged prostate, medication and surgery can help.
Meanwhile, prostate-cancer-treatment techniques such as nerve-sparing robotic surgery aim to protect more of the area around the bladder when removing the prostate than traditional methods which can cause incontinence. ""As surgeons, we try to minimize the damage to those structures,"" says Ash Tewari, a prostate-cancer surgeon and chair of the urology department at the Mount Sinai Health System. Dr. Tewari developed a technique to restore muscles after the prostate is removed, allowing for more rapid recovery of urinary control than with other surgical methods.
Dr. Tewari also advises even those without prostate problems to adopt healthy bladder habits and do their Kegel exercises, telling them, ""You will thank me when you are 85.""

If the many health issues that come with aging, one of the most vexing is also among the hardest to talk about, even with a doctor: a troublesome bladder.
Now, researchers and doctors are mounting new efforts to erase the stigma, inform patients about the best treatment options—and prevent problems from starting in the first place by promoting better bladder health.
One-third of Americans 40 and older report suffering from urinary incontinence—the accidental leakage of urine—at least ""sometimes,"" according to the nonprofit
Urology Care Foundation
. By interfering with daily life, incontinence can cause emotional, psychological and social distress. It occurs twice as often in women, but also affects 1 in 4 men.
It's no wonder that the adult-incontinence-product market is burgeoning world-wide, and that a growing number of treatments are available to manage bladder function. These include surgical procedures, implanted devices, injections of Botox and prescription drugs.
Yet many sufferers wait years before seeking care, if they seek it at all. Untreated, incontinence contributes to misery in old age, and is associated with falls and fractures, sleep problems, depression and urinary-tract infections.
'Too embarrassed'
""Every day, we see patients who say, 'I'm too embarrassed to talk about this,' and they are always shocked when we tell them how common it is,"" says Donna Mazloomdoost, program director of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which sponsored a new study that aims to improve how women are counseled and treated.
One of the most bothersome types of urinary incontinence is urgency incontinence, a symptom of overactive bladder, which happens when the bladder muscle spontaneously contracts, leading to a sudden and strong urge to urinate, even if the bladder isn't full. Another type, stress incontinence, occurs when weak support around the urethra lets urine escape. This can happen during exercise, walking, lifting something or even after a sneeze, cough or laugh.
The causes vary by sex. For women, incontinence issues can start after pregnancy or chronic conditions that weaken the pelvic muscles and worsen over time. High-impact sports and vigorous activities are associated with stress incontinence in girls and women in their reproductive years, and menopause can bring on overactive bladder and incontinence. A 2018
poll
conducted by the University of Michigan found nearly half of women over 50 experienced moderate to severe incontinence but two-thirds hadn't talked to their doctor about it.
Stress incontinence is less common in men. But overactive bladder is more likely in men with prostate problems including prostatitis, a painful inflammation of the prostate gland, and benign prostate hyperplasia, an enlargement of the gland that can happen as men age. Incontinence is also a common side effect of radiation and surgery for prostate cancer, including overflow incontinence, which may result in a constant drip.
Lifestyle factors
For both sexes, incontinence can result from diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and lifestyle habits that directly affect the bladder. Researchers are also studying the role of the urobiome—communities of bacteria that live in the urinary tract and are unique to each person. Imbalances in the urobiome can be linked to common bladder issues and might help predict which patients will respond to specific treatments, says Linda Brubaker, a urogynecologist at UC San Diego Health, part of the University of California.
Often, lifestyle changes such as losing weight and quitting smoking can help stave off or ease bladder problems. Excess weight weakens pelvic-floor muscles, while smoking causes coughing that can also lead to bladder leaks.
""There's a general lack of awareness about healthy bladder habits, but most people can be helped by using simple common sense,"" says Dr. Brubaker. ""Treat your bladder well by filling it in a kind way and then emptying it regularly,"" she advises. Pelvic-floor strengthening using a technique known as Kegel
exercises
can strengthen muscles that control the bladder, and behavioral techniques such as suppressing the urge to run to the bathroom can help regain control over the bladder and suppress urgency.
Fluid intake—how much and what type—obviously plays a role. Caffeine and alcohol can be bladder stimulants, and it's better to drink small amounts of fluid frequently than to drink nothing for four hours and then drink 16 ounces in 10 minutes.
Treatment for urgency incontinence may begin with prescriptions for behavioral and exercise techniques and medications for overactive bladder that work by helping the bladder empty more fully or tighten muscles to lessen leakage. Stress incontinence can also be treated with exercise, but when symptoms don't improve in women, an outpatient surgical procedure to place a thin strip of mesh under the urethra, known as a sling, is commonly used to prevent leaks.
Double whammy
As many as half of women with incontinence have both urgency and stress incontinence, a combination that is especially tough to manage. Standard treatment guidelines suggest that surgery may worsen the urgency component, so doctors might not offer it as an option early on. However, a
study
of 480 women with mixed incontinence, co-authored by Dr. Mazloomdoost and published in September in the Journal of the American Medical Association, challenged that approach, finding that it may unnecessarily delay surgery that can help women with mixed urinary incontinence.
Women in the randomized study had either just the surgery or the surgery plus behavioral and pelvic-floor muscle therapy. After a year, both groups showed significant improvements. However, those who combined surgery and physical therapy reported fewer instances of incontinence and were less likely to receive additional treatment such as overactive-bladder medications, suggesting they had more quality-of-life improvement than the surgery-alone group.
Shirley Javery, 80 years old, says her doctor In Rhode Island suggested she take part in the study, led by urogynecologist Vivian Sung of Women & Infants Hospital and Brown University's medical school there. Ms. Javery says she is in good health, walks several miles a day and swims. But in her 70s, she developed mixed incontinence. ""Every time I sneezed, I peed all over myself, and I was always running to the bathroom,"" Ms. Javery says. She hated the idea of wearing adult diapers, or putting a crimp in her style. She was in the group that had both surgery and pelvic exercises with behavioral therapy, and kept a diary of urinary frequency and symptoms. The results, she says, ""have been awesome, and I can sneeze without peeing. I feel like I'm in my 20s again.""
Burden for men
For men with enlarged prostate which causes a weak urine stream or a constant need to pee, several types of medication either shrink the prostate, halt its growth or relax muscles, helping improve flow. For more advanced cases or those that don't respond well to medication, surgeons continue to refine procedures to reduce or remove the enlarged part of the prostate to restore normal urinary flow.
Meanwhile, prostate-cancer-treatment techniques such as nerve-sparing robotic surgery aim to protect more of the area around the bladder when removing the prostate than traditional methods which can cause temporary or permanent incontinence.
""As surgeons, we try to minimize the damage to those structures,"" says Ash Tewari, a prostate-cancer surgeon and chair of the urology department at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Dr. Tewari developed a technique to restore muscles after the prostate is removed, allowing for more rapid recovery of urinary control compared with other surgical methods, though some men may need additional procedures.
Dr. Tewari also advises men after prostate surgery and even those without prostate problems to adopt healthy bladder habits and do their Kegel exercises, telling them, ""You will thank me when you are 85.""

Marine commando Randy Hoffman's plane took off from Kabul, climbed over the jagged mountains and turned toward home.
Somewhere below was his tent, a piece of canvas stretched across a pit he had carved into a high-altitude ridge. Randy had spent most of the previous 2 1/2 years in the mountains along the Pakistan border, turning Afghan villagers into soldiers.
Rugs covered the tent's dirt floor. He had a wood stove for heat and collected catalogs of farm equipment and RVs to remind him of home in Indiana. A metal thermos stored the goat's milk and cucumber drink delivered each morning by the mountain men who fought alongside him. He and the Afghans would sit on a dirt bench, talking about poetry, faith and honor, and how to make it through the next day alive.
Randy's camp watched over the narrow passes and smuggling paths used by al Qaeda and Taliban militants to sneak into Afghanistan from Pakistan. He kept mortars aimed at likely approaches. At times, he was the only American for miles.
On Randy's last trip down the mountains, a caravan of Afghan fighters in Toyota pickups escorted him on the seven-hour drive to a U.S. base. From there, he caught a helicopter to Kabul and trimmed the beard he had grown so he wouldn't stand out as a target during gunfights.
It was July 2005. As Randy headed home, he couldn't escape one thought. U.S. troops had been in Afghanistan for three years and nine months -- as long as they had fought in World War II. Yet the Afghan war wasn't close to won.
On the flight home, Randy pictured the many villagers lost in combat, men he had come to admire for their courage and strict sense of right and wrong. He thought about those left legless by militant bombings and now facing a life ahead in mud-brick compounds perched on mountainsides.
He turned away from the others on the plane and cried.
Since the first U.S. troops arrived in 2001, Afghanistan has become a generational war. The youngest recruits stepping off the bus at boot camp today were born after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that ignited the conflict they may soon fight.
Col. Randy Hoffman served seven combat tours in Afghanistan, six of them highly classified missions, and one stint in Iraq. Afghanistan brought him promotions. It rewarded the rural boy from Danville, Ind., with a bronze star medal for valor. It transformed a middling student into a scholar of history and war.
Afghanistan also nearly cost Randy his sanity. It buried friends. It almost ended his career. It ripped ragged edges around a gentle personality.
It strained his marriage and frightened his children. The family began referring to itself as Hoffmanistan, a dark joke reflecting Afghanistan's long reach into their daily lives.
Eighteen years after the Sept. 11 hijackings spurred the U.S.-led invasion to oust the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies, American troops are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan. Negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban have lurched forward and stumbled backward.
Over the course of the war, 775,000 U.S. troops have fought in Afghanistan; 28,000 of them have served five or more tours. More than 2,300 Americans have died there, and 20,000 have suffered wounds, including amputated limbs and brain injuries.
A much larger number, more than 120,000, returned home with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, the hidden wounds of America's longest war.
Randy first kissed Dawn on the night before he left for boot camp in 1985. She was the little sister of his best friend, and he had known her since she was 6 years old. They grew up during an era of skateboards and mullets in Danville, a town of 4,000 in central Indiana.
Dawn was an honor student at Danville High School. Randy brought up the rear. He gathered the nerve to ask her out when she was 15, and he was 18.
After Randy left for the Marines, Dawn waited for him. He earned a spot in an elite Force Reconnaissance platoon. She studied nursing.
They married in 1991, and the couple settled into an upstairs apartment in the house of Randy's parents. They stocked it with furnishings salvaged from their childhood bedrooms.
Randy attended Indiana University and earned an officer's commission. Military service was part of his heritage. His father and two uncles were Marines.
He was 2 years old in 1968 when his uncle Terry Hoffman, a helicopter crew chief, was shot down in Vietnam. The aircraft split in half, and Terry's body was thrown far from the wreckage. He was still listed as missing in action after Saigon's fall in 1975.
A Vietnamese farmer found Terry's remains and kept them. When the farmer died, his family gave a jawbone to authorities, who passed it along to a U.S. casualty-recovery team.
In 1994, Randy's first duty as a second lieutenant was to escort Uncle Terry's remains home. He handed his grandmother the American flag, folded into a triangle, on behalf of ""the president of the United States, the United States Marine Corps and a grateful nation.""
The day of the Sept. 11 attacks, Randy was at a Marine Corps school at the base near Quantico, Va.
Military officers asked students if any spoke Urdu, Arabic, Farsi or Pashto. Randy had studied Arabic in college, but he didn't feel fluent enough to put up his hand. The military decided any Arabic was good enough.
Officials hustled Randy to a Navy office near the Pentagon and told him he would likely be sent overseas on a secret special-operations mission. ""We suggest you talk to your wife,"" an officer told him.
By mid-2002, Randy was attached to Special Operations Command. He joined about 20 commandos assigned to recruit, train and lead Afghan militiamen who would become the core of an Afghan national guard.
The U.S. military was desperate to learn what was going on in Afghanistan, and Randy was ordered to collect intelligence about who was on whose side in the villages along the country's mountainous border with Pakistan.
The U.S. had overthrown Afghanistan's Taliban regime in 2001 with a few thousand troops and Central Intelligence Agency operatives, as well as Afghan militias. The fighting ebbed within months, and few people in the George W. Bush administration called for more forces after the surviving Taliban and their al Qaeda allies fled to Pakistan.
When Randy showed up in Khost province in January 2003, there were fewer than 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The Bush administration was weeks away from launching a full-scale invasion of Iraq. Afghanistan, if not forgotten, was largely considered won.
While America's attention was on Iraq, fanatical fighters, including Arabs, Chechens and other foreigners, probed Afghanistan's defenses, trying to undo the 2001 defeat of Taliban rule.
The Pashtuns of eastern and southern Afghanistan made up the Taliban's power base. Randy's job was to persuade the tribesmen to ally with the U.S. and train them to defend the border against al Qaeda and Taliban militants.
Randy set up five tented command posts along 60 miles of border, hiking from one to the other.
To woo the Pashtuns, Randy lived as they did. He let his hair and beard grow. He wore an Afghan tunic and trousers for meetings with elders. He slept on a mat on the floor of his tent or in the bed of his Toyota pickup.
Randy visited villages to learn of roaming Arab fighters. He and other commandos distributed vaccines, malaria pills and Tylenol.
In villages hostile to the U.S., he handed out crayons and a coloring book he drew. The illustrations and Quranic verses explained why Americans had come to Afghanistan. ""In the year 2001 on the 11 of September, evil and bad people named al Qaeda attacked America,"" read the caption for a sketch of the Twin Towers in flames.
Randy told village leaders that al Qaeda had killed 3,000 from his clan. ""I'm here to extract payment for this blood feud,"" he said.
The Pashtuns understood. You've got a blood feud? We get it.
Randy gathered Pashtun warriors and, with the help of an interpreter, drew on a white board to illustrate how to take advantage of the terrain during firefights and how to conduct an ambush.
The American started with a force of 250 village men. By the time he finished his sixth tour in 2005, Randy had trained 3,000.
Enemy fighters wanted to move men and arms through the mountain passes in Afghanistan. The Marine and his Afghans were in the way. Randy's camps were attacked several times a month. Sometimes it was a single shot or a rocket volley. Other times, dozens of al Qaeda fighters tried to overrun his position.
At first, the militants whom Randy and his men killed were Syrian, Yemeni, Sudanese and Chechen. As time went on, al Qaeda militants tried to stay out of danger by sending boys from Pakistani religious schools to set up ambushes and plant booby-traps in dry riverbeds used as roads. The boys hid nearby and triggered the explosives with garage-door openers.
Randy's truck was in the lead on a patrol in 2003 when he stopped to check his radio. His Afghan comrades drove past him and over one of the hidden bombs. Eight men were blown to pieces.
A euphoria filled Randy, a feeling of being more alive than he had ever felt. Then a wave of grief washed away his near-death relief. He couldn't stop thinking about one of the dead, a timid farmer who had volunteered to be a militia commander. Randy had been tough on him, and he wished he had just once told the man he was doing a good job.
In late 2004, Randy and a few trucks carrying his fighters drove down to a base in Jalalabad for fresh food and a break from the fighting. In a valley below, he spotted a convoy of Marine Corps Humvees.
Randy was excited to see some comrades. He found the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Norm Cooling, who eyed the Marine in long hair and beard.
I know that guy from somewhere, the colonel thought. Then it dawned on him. A decade earlier, when he was a company commander, Randy had been one of his most promising young lieutenants.
""Gee, Randy,"" the colonel joked. ""I didn't know you had gotten out of the Marine Corps.""
Manning the radio in the Marine convoy was a 21-year-old corporal named Eric Lueken, from Dubois, Ind. A year earlier, Eric, dissatisfied with working the night shift at a water-treatment plant, had walked into the recruiters office in Evansville, Ind.
Eric came home and told his surprised parents he had enlisted. ""I'm leaving in three weeks,"" he said.
Randy had greeted Eric the day he spotted the Marine convoy, asking the radio operator where to find the commander. It was a passing moment that gave no hint of the fates at play, that Cpl. Lueken would form a link in a chain of events that changed Randy's life.
In 2004, Dawn was home in Fredericksburg, Va., with the children, Shawn and Caroline, when she saw Marines in a government van drive by the house. The van made a U-turn and passed again.
Dawn saw it coming -- a knock on the door, and uniformed men delivering a regret-to-inform-you. She and Randy had talked about the possibility. She steeled herself for the children's sake.
""Your reaction will be their reaction,"" she told herself.
It turned out the Marines in the van were looking for a lost dog.
The constant threat of widowhood forced Dawn to become more independent. She imagined moving the family back to Indiana if Randy were killed.
Between combat tours, Randy briefed officials at the Pentagon and then returned home for a few awkward weeks with Dawn. She saw disturbing changes in her husband's personality. He had never been a yeller. Now he was agitated from war and couldn't keep a lid on his volatile moods.
During one visit home, Dawn told him: ""Could you lighten up a little? My friends think you're weird.""
Randy shrugged off Dawn's concerns. He didn't believe in post-traumatic stress disorder. Anyone who complained of it was weak, and Marine officers weren't supposed to show weakness.
After a few trips home, Randy secretly wished he could skip the strained reunions and wrenching farewells. Life was simpler at war.
Randy felt he had won over the Pashtuns on his stretch of the border and turned them into a weapon to defend Afghanistan and, in turn, America.
Leaving the mountains for the last time in 2005, he worried that the U.S. was failing to secure its early inroads with the Pashtuns. Every villager alienated by a careless raid or an insult was a potential Taliban recruit.
Randy earned the bronze star for his service in Afghanistan. He found it almost embarrassing. The Pashtuns had taken far greater risks on his orders. For many fighters it was a last act that drew no medals. He lost 80 to 100 men over 2 1/2 years, one of them decapitated by a helicopter blade.
Aboard the military transport plane heading home, Randy mourned. ""I loved living with those guys,"" he said.
The Marine Corps returned Randy to Indiana to help train a company of reservists. He and Dawn figured he would retire there after this one last posting. They bought a farmhouse in Ladoga, Ind., population 1,100.
At the time, the U.S. was consumed by the insurgencies in Iraq unleashed by Saddam Hussein's overthrow. By the end of 2006, U.S. fatalities in Iraq surpassed the number of deaths from Sept. 11.
The U.S. military, short-handed and fighting two wars, sent Reserve and National Guard troops into battle. Randy's job was preparing these part-time warriors -- electricians, teachers, cops, prison guards -- to fight in Iraq.
Militants had learned to improvise land mines, burying them along roads or concealing them in buildings. Insurgents fashioned triggers from garage-door openers, cellphones and transmitters for radio-controlled toys. They calibrated pressure-sensitive detonators to explode under the step of a soldier or the wheels of an armored vehicle.
In 2006, Brig. Gen. Bob Neller, deputy commander for operations of Marine forces in Iraq, was struggling to stem the mounting toll of Marines killed or injured by roadside bombs. Each week, he held a meeting to bat around ideas.
Gen. Neller suggested mounting wheeled rollers on the front of Humvees to set off a buried bomb before the vehicle drove over it. Explosives specialists argued against the idea: A bomb set off by a mine roller would spray shrapnel toward the turret gunner, who often rode with head and shoulders exposed.
For a couple of weeks, the general hesitated over a decision. Then he lost another Marine to a roadside bomb. It was Cpl. Eric Lueken, the radio operator Randy Hoffman had met in Afghanistan two years earlier.
When the report of Eric's death landed on Gen. Neller's desk, the general was jolted out of indecision. He ordered engineers to start building mine rollers. ""You've got one week to come up with a prototype,"" he said. Eric Lueken's battalion was the first to test the devices in the field.
In Indiana, Randy's phone rang. As the senior active-duty Marine officer in the area, it fell to him to inform families in parts of Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky that their loved ones had died in combat. The Marine calling from the casualty section told him to deliver the bad news to Eric's parents.
Randy and 1st Sgt. Troy Euclide drove two hours to Dubois. Melinda and Jake Lueken lived in an A-frame house surrounded by bean fields and turkey farms. Randy and Troy made a reconnaissance pass of the house and saw an American flag outside.
After driving by, they stopped on a side road and prayed. ""God, help us give this terrible news to the family,"" Randy said.
Melinda knew what was coming when she saw Randy and Troy at the front door. Randy's words spilled out: ""I'm sorry to tell you Eric was killed yesterday in Iraq.""
""Oh, my God, no,"" Melinda said. She took Eric's boot-camp portrait down from the wall and slumped onto the sofa, hugging the frame to her chest as she rocked back and forth.
The bomb had done such damage to Eric's body that military morticians in Dover, Del., took weeks to prepare it. When Eric's remains finally arrived at the airport in Louisville, Ky., mourners lined the roads to Dubois.
Over three years of duty in Indiana, Randy buried nine Marines and paid dozens of visits to grieving families. He set up a special ringtone to signal phone calls from the casualty section. He and Dawn jumped whenever it sounded. She hated that ring.
Randy began drinking, two or three glasses of wine a day, a lot for him. While driving, he sometimes got heart palpitations and tunnel vision.
""It was death notification after death notification,"" Dawn said. ""He couldn't get his head above water.""
One winter day, Shawn and Caroline, bundled in snowsuits, were sliding down the front hill on plaster saucers when some neighborhood boys came by with their own sleds.
Randy heard the older kids swearing. Watching through the window, Dawn saw Randy storm outside, grab one of the boys and scream at him. He lined them up and took their pictures, the same way he photographed captured insurgents in Afghanistan.
""Why?"" Dawn demanded, taking his phone and deleting the photos. Randy apologized to the boys.
One time at a crowded gas station, Randy got into a spat with an older woman. ""Get back in your car,"" he yelled.
When he tried to apologize, the woman rebuffed him: ""You're a rude man.""
""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm not usually that way.""
The older children saw that the slightest irritation could set him off. They learned to stifle sneezes in the car and to wake him gently.
Caroline once wrote ""Dad is scary"" on a piece of paper and hid it in a pink lockbox, where she kept her treasures. Shawn ran off with the note and showed it to their dad.
Randy was horrified. ""You have no reason to be scared of me,"" he told Caroline.
Dawn wondered what had happened to the man she married.
By the end of Randy's three-year posting, Indiana didn't feel like home to him anymore, and he wanted out. Every road brought to mind a mother weeping at a screen door or a shovelful of dirt thumping onto a casket.
Dawn wanted to stay close to her family.
The Marine Corps ended the debate in 2008 and ordered Randy back to the Quantico base in Virginia.
The Bush administration was coming to an end. The Taliban and other insurgent groups were staging a comeback that Randy and others had feared. Building and training Afghan security forces progressed slowly.
Mr. Bush believed his troop surge had turned the tide in Iraq, and he tried the same approach in Afghanistan. The 27,000 U.S. troops in the country at the beginning of 2008 had grown to 35,000 when President Obama took office in 2009. Mr. Obama campaigned on his opposition to the war in Iraq while pointing to Afghanistan as a conflict the U.S. was obliged to fight.
""Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backward,"" Mr. Obama said at a West Point speech in his first year as commander in chief. ""I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops.""
The Marines sent Randy to Command and Staff College, a graduate program at Quantico for promising majors.
At the end of the school year in 2009, Randy and his class heard a presentation on post-traumatic stress disorder. As a speaker listed the symptoms, Randy fought the urge to race out of the auditorium. During a break, he fled to the men's room and dry-heaved.
Afterward, he found his faculty adviser. ""I have to share something,"" he said. Randy sat at a table with classmates and, for 90 minutes, unloaded stories of trauma that he couldn't contain any longer. ""Something is going to happen to me,"" he said.
A nurse, Kim Bradley, listened at the table. She assisted troops suffering from PTSD for a military charity. Randy, she thought, was a textbook case. She gave him a business card. ""Call me if you need anything,"" she said.
Randy moved on to the School of Advanced Warfighting, a selective program that takes officers to visit the world's battlefields.
By then, Randy's friends knew he was struggling with anxiety and depression. The Marine Corps still saw him as an officer with an extraordinary record.
In July 2009, the Marines announced that Randy would be promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent back to Afghanistan as commander of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, known since Vietnam as the Magnificent Bastards.
In Afghanistan, Mr. Obama's troop escalation was gaining steam. By the war's peak in 2010 and 2011, more than 100,000 U.S. troops would be deployed there.
The prospect of leading men into battle sent Randy into a panic. He stayed in bed for three days. He lost his appetite and was short of breath. He stopped showing up at school.
Randy felt like he was unraveling in front of everyone at a time when admitting to post-traumatic stress would almost certainly end a Marine Corps career.
Dawn was too worried about Randy's collapse to fret about his job. Screw the Marine Corps, she thought. I don't care who knows. I want this fixed. She rifled through Randy's wallet for the business card of Kim Bradley, the nurse. She called, desperate for help.
Kim set up appointments for Randy with a therapist at Fort Belvoir, Va. A medical team there diagnosed him with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, and doctors prescribed drugs for anxiety and depression.
Randy came clean with one of his oldest Marine Corps friends, Kirk Mullins. Randy and Kirk had been enlisted men who made the jump to officers together.
""Dude, I'm not doing well,"" Randy said. He looked haggard and distraught, and he couldn't explain what was happening.
Randy didn't trust himself behind the wheel. All summer, Kirk drove his friend to Fort Belvoir for Randy's therapy sessions.
One day, Randy confessed: ""I'm in no condition to lead Marines, and I don't know when I'm going to be in that position, if ever.""
Randy also told his boss, Col. Tracy King, his doubts about commanding troops in Afghanistan. The colonel escorted Randy to talk to Gen. Neller, who had been promoted to major general and named head of Marine Corps schools at Quantico.
""Sir, I'm considering declining command,"" Randy said. ""I'm concerned that I will let my Marines down.""
Gen. Neller, who had lost 314 troops in Iraq from 2006 through 2007, including Cpl. Lueken, was sympathetic.
""All of us came back from Iraq and Afghanistan different than when we left,"" the general said. He urged Randy to take a few months to decide and to give him an answer after Christmas.
Over the holidays, Randy convinced himself he could do it all: Keep a lid on his post-traumatic stress and lead Marines in combat. He and Dawn returned to tell Col. King that he was ready to lead the Magnificent Bastards.
During their meeting, Col. King warned Dawn that her husband's assignment would be a two-person job: While Randy was in Afghanistan, she would be expected to comfort wives, help troubled children and console grieving families. At the same time, Dawn's own mother was dying of cancer.
Randy read resignation on Dawn's face.
That afternoon, he returned alone to Col. King's office and turned down the job. ""I want the Marines to have a battalion commander who's in the game,"" Randy said.
Dawn was fixing dinner when Randy came home and told her.
""What are they going to do with us now?"" she asked.
To Randy's surprise, Gen. Neller worked to keep him in the Marine Corps. The general arranged for him to serve two years as deputy director of the School of Advanced Warfighting.
When Randy felt stable, Gen. Neller told him, he could apply again for command. ""In my opinion, you did everything we ask our Marine officers to do,"" the general said. ""I'm not going to punish that.""
As word spread, Randy's decision stunned Marines. It was the first time they had seen an officer decline battalion command because of post-traumatic stress and, even more surprising to them, continue to advance.
It was a turning point for Randy -- and for the Marine Corps. About 15% of those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq returned home with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Col. King, now a major general, said Randy's honesty led the Marines to become more accepting of the emotional damage that war inflicts on those who fight. He has told Randy's story to hundreds of young officers.
By 2012, Randy felt stable, and he again put his name in for battalion command. Such assignments are determined by a panel of 21 generals and colonels in secret deliberations.
When Randy's name came up, the debate was heated. ""There were some officers in the room who couldn't get past the stigma that he had declined his first selection for command,"" said Lt. Col. C.J. Williams, Randy's former commander in Indiana, now a full colonel.
Randy's supporters prevailed, and the Corps gave him command of 750 Marines who taught leadership to new lieutenants at a school in Quantico. He created and led a course on combat stress and filled in the curriculum with details of his own struggle.
Some of his students had already served in Afghanistan or Iraq as enlisted Marines before becoming officers, and the relatively slow pace at Quantico gave their troubles a chance to rise to the surface.
Alarmed wives began calling Dawn about their husbands. Randy made sure they contacted Kim Bradley, the nurse, for help.
In 2012, Gen. Joe Dunford, then-assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, visited Quantico for Mess Night, a traditional dinner where Marines donned evening dress uniforms.
Randy sat next to Gen. Dunford at the head table. As assistant commandant, Gen. Dunford focused on how the Corps cared for its wounded, including those with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress. When they dined that night, he already knew Randy's story.
At dinner, they talked about Afghanistan. Gen. Dunford didn't let on that within a few days Mr. Obama would name him commander of U.S. and allied forces there.
When the nomination became public, Randy sent the general an email: ""I'd like to go."" He sought to ease any concerns about his post-trauma stress, referring instead to his ""post-traumatic growth."" In part, though, Randy wanted to return to Afghanistan to see if he had fully put his trauma behind him.
Months later, Gen. Dunford invited Randy to join his planning staff in Kabul.
The city in 2013 didn't resemble the Afghanistan of a decade earlier. The nimble commando campaign that followed the Sept. 11 attacks had stalled behind concrete blast walls.
Mr. Obama was looking for an exit and had scaled U.S. forces back to 68,000 troops by the end of the 2012 warm-weather fighting season. Under the president's plan, the U.S. presence would drop to 10,000 troops by the end of 2014, leaving the U.S.-trainedAfghan military to battle the Taliban. U.S. special operators and American air power would hunt al Qaeda and other terror groups.
Hundreds of U.S. bases and outposts were bulldozed, closed or turned over to the Afghans. Among his jobs, Randy had to figure out how to move out a decade's worth of war materiel.
Insurgents were spreading havoc with high-profile bombings and attacks. In 2014, they sneaked weapons into the Serena Hotel in Kabul, a popular spot for expatriates, and killed nine people.
From his perch near Gen. Dunford, Randy better appreciated the war's complexity. What seemed like a simple path to victory -- fight hard, show respect and win Pashtun allies -- wasn't so easy to achieve.
During a foray from Kabul, an obliging helicopter pilot flew Randy over the ridges and valleys where he had lost many friends. The contours of the SpÄ«n Ghar range were still carved deep into his memory.
At the time, a charity was bringing veterans of the Afghan war back to visit places where they had fought. The men had been carried off the battlefield on stretchers; now they returned with prosthetic limbs and disfiguring burns, seeking emotional healing to match their physical recovery.
Randy arranged their travel to villages, mountainsides and farm fields. ""I knew how they felt coming back,"" he said. ""It was almost like medicine to me.""
When Randy packed for home in 2014, Gen. Dunford gave a short speech. Randy's return to Afghanistan, he said, ""was good for him, a little closure.""
For years, Gen. Neller dwelled on Cpl. Lueken's death and his own initial reluctance to order mine rollers to protect his men. In 2014, he had Eric's name and the date of his death engraved on a black metal bracelet. The following year, Gen. Neller rose to commandant, the top officer in the Marine Corps.
Jake Lueken, Eric's father, heard about the bracelet and sent word that he wanted to talk. Gen. Neller took a week or so to get up the nerve to call. When he did, he told Jake about his hesitation to order mine rollers until Eric's death spurred him to action.
In 2016, a decade after Eric died, Gen. Neller traveled to Indiana to meet Jake and Melinda, as well as the family of another fallen Marine.
During their visit to Eric's grave at St. Raphael cemetery, Gen. Neller knelt in the grass, balled his fist and hit the polished black-granite marker. ""Sorry, Eric, it took me so long to get here,"" he said.
Time revealed a series of connections among Randy, Gen. Neller, Lt. Col. Cooling and the Luekens. Gen. Neller realized that Randy's breakdown had been sparked, in part, by the visit to tell the Luekens that Eric had been killed. Randy learned that Gen. Neller, the man who had saved his career and perhaps his sanity, was himself haunted by Eric's death.
Randy stayed at the Luekens' house during a later visit by Gen. Neller to Indiana in 2017. Looking at family photos with Melinda, Randy realized for the first time that Eric was the same radio man he had met on the road to Jalalabad early in the war.
The next day, Norm Cooling -- Eric's commander in Afghanistan and Iraq -- visited the St. Raphael cemetery with Randy and the Luekens. Over dinner, Lt. Col. Cooling, by then a brigadier general, told Jake and Melinda that mine rollers had saved many lives since Eric's death.
Military analysts estimated the devices prevented some 5,000 deaths or injuries among U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan alone.
In 2017, Randy was promoted to full colonel. He moved his family to the Marine Corps boot camp set among the swamps and palmetto trees on Parris Island, S.C. From there, Randy would drive to see his therapist in Savannah, Ga.
The Marines under Randy's command taught combat skills to new recruits, who were often straight out of high school.
The young men and women arrived by bus after dark and lined up on yellow footprints painted on the pavement. The men's heads were shaved, and everyone's possessions were locked up. Their individuality was stripped away by drill instructors charged with recasting them into disciplined Marines. They quickly learned to refer to themselves in the third person.
Near the rifle range, Randy gathered 160 male recruits one day this summer and asked what they remembered of Sept. 11, 2001. ""This recruit was in fourth grade, he believes, when it happened,"" one said. ""This recruit's teacher stepped out of class and came back teary-eyed.""
The young men sat rapt as Randy described what it was like to kill. ""Your heart rate is uncontrollable,"" he said. ""Your pulse goes up so much that your ears kind of stop up. Everything goes kind of in slow motion. Your brain focuses on minute details to help you get through engaging the enemy before he can kill you.""
Randy revealed he had been in and out of therapy for more than a decade. ""I'm not embarrassed to tell you,"" he said. Combat, he added, ""takes a mental and emotional toll on any human being.""
Weeks later, Randy began what will likely be his last tour in the Marines, running the regional Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps out of Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Fla.
He has decorated his office with photos of his father and his late Uncle Terry in Marine uniform; a set of bottles containing soil and stones from Chancellorsville, Iwo Jima, Troy, Verdun, Weiyuan Fort and other long-ago battlefields; bricks he retrieved from the ruins of Osama bin Laden's camp in Afghanistan.
The Hoffmans' youngest, 15-year-old Emma, jokes that if she inherits her dad's dirt collection, she will bury it with him.
Hoffmanistan is quieter, if not fully at peace.
Randy, 53, sinks into anxiety some days but not many. ""There is an edge to his personality that he didn't used to have,"" said Dawn, 49. ""I don't think that PTSD ever goes away. But there is healing that springs from that.""
""I was not prepared for that emotional toll,"" Randy said, looking back on a life at war. Yet he feels more contented than he has since before Sept. 11.
Randy, who will probably retire at the end of his tour in Tallahassee, tracks Afghanistan peace negotiations. He wonders if the Marines he trains will fight in the same mountains he did. He fears the war will end like Vietnam, with Americans again abandoning those who fought by their side.
He also thinks about the brotherhood he felt with his Afghan fighters; the Pashtun villagers who survived childhood because of medical care from American commandos; the way the Marine Corps stood by him.
""Even if the outcome is not good,"" he said, ""I still have those small wins, and that's what I hang onto.""
Dawn has turned her nurse's training into a career helping troops come home. She fields calls at all hours from troubled vets and worried spouses.
She was taught early in life that family problems should be kept hidden. Randy's war made it impossible for her to conceal her own family's troubles. Surviving them has given Dawn a but-for-the-grace-of-God understanding of human foibles and more compassion for others.
The Hoffman children weren't the only kids growing up in their military neighborhoods whose fathers came home damaged. Shawn, 22, and Caroline, 20, are in college. These days they take their father's flare-ups less personally.
""He's fighting this invisible battle all the time,"" Caroline said.
Emma, a ninth-grader, missed the worst times. She plans to join the Marines. ""I've grown up very proud of my dad,"" she said. The teen recognizes the risk of post-traumatic stress, but says there is therapy for that.
Randy thinks Emma would make an excellent Marine. Dawn hopes she changes her mind.

Marine commando Randy Hoffman's plane took off from Kabul, climbed over the jagged mountains and turned toward home.
Somewhere down there was his tent, a piece of canvas stretched across a pit he had carved into a high-altitude ridge. Randy had spent most of the previous 2½ years in the mountains along the Pakistan border,
turning Afghan villagers into soldiers.

Rugs covered the tent's dirt floor. He had a wood stove for heat and collected catalogs of farm equipment and RVs to remind him of home in Indiana. A metal thermos stored the goat's milk and cucumber drink delivered each morning by the mountain men who fought alongside him. He and the Afghans would sit on a dirt bench, talking about poetry, faith and honor, and how to make it through the next day alive.
Randy's camp watched over the narrow passes and smuggling paths used by al Qaeda and Taliban militants to sneak into Afghanistan from Pakistan. He kept mortars aimed at likely approaches. At times, he was the only American for miles.
On Randy's last trip down the mountains, a caravan of Afghan fighters in Toyota pickups escorted him on the seven-hour drive to a U.S. base. From there, he caught a helicopter to Kabul and trimmed the beard he had grown so he wouldn't stand out as a target during gunfights.
It was July 2005. As Randy headed home, he couldn't escape one thought. U.S. troops had been in Afghanistan for three years and nine months—as long as they had fought in World War II. Yet the Afghan war wasn't close to won.
On the flight home, Randy pictured the many villagers lost in combat, men he had come to admire for their courage and strict sense of right and wrong. He thought about those left legless by militant bombings and now facing a life ahead in mud-brick compounds perched on mountainsides.
He turned away from the others on the plane and cried.
Since the first U.S. troops arrived in 2001, Afghanistan has become a generational war. The youngest recruits stepping off the bus at boot camp today were born after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that ignited the war they may soon fight.
Col. Randy Hoffman served seven combat tours in Afghanistan, six of them highly classified missions, and one stint in Iraq. Afghanistan brought him promotions. It rewarded the rural boy from Danville, Ind., with a bronze star medal for valor. It transformed a middling student into a scholar of history and war.
Afghanistan also nearly cost Randy his sanity. It buried friends. It almost ended his career. It ripped ragged edges around a gentle personality.
It strained his marriage and frightened his children. The family began referring to itself as Hoffmanistan, a dark joke reflecting Afghanistan's long reach into their daily lives.
Eighteen years after the Sept. 11 hijackings spurred the U.S.-led invasion to oust the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies, American troops are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan.
Negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban
have lurched forward and stumbled backward.
Over the course of the war, 775,000 U.S. troops have fought in Afghanistan; 28,000 of them have served five or more tours. More than 2,300 Americans have died there, and 20,000 have suffered wounds, including amputated limbs and brain injuries.
A much larger number, more than 120,000, returned home with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, the hidden wounds of America's longest war.
Call of duty
Randy first kissed Dawn on the night before he left for boot camp in 1985.
She was the little sister of his best friend, and he had known her since she was 6 years old. They grew up during an era of skateboards and mullets in Danville, a town of 4,000 in the center of Indiana.
Dawn was an honor student at Danville High School. Randy brought up the rear. He gathered the nerve to ask her out when she was 15, and he was 18.
After Randy left for the Marines, Dawn waited for him. He earned a spot in an elite Force Reconnaissance platoon. She studied nursing.
They married in 1991, and the couple settled into an upstairs apartment in the house of Randy's parents. They stocked it with furnishings salvaged from their childhood bedrooms.
Randy attended Indiana University and earned an officer's commission. Military service was part of his heritage. His father and two uncles were Marines.
He was 2 years old in 1968 when his uncle Terry Hoffman, a helicopter crew chief, was shot down in Vietnam. The aircraft split in half, and Terry's body was thrown far from the wreckage. He was still listed as missing in action after Saigon's fall in 1975. Randy saw his grandmother cover her mouth in shock as she watched TV reports of the last Americans boarding helicopters, leaving her son behind.
A Vietnamese farmer found Terry's remains and kept them. When the farmer died, his family gave a jawbone to authorities, who passed it along to a U.S. casualty-recovery team.
In 1994, Randy's first duty as a second lieutenant was to escort Uncle Terry's remains home. He knelt and handed his grandmother the American flag, folded tightly into a triangle, on behalf of ""the president of the United States, the United States Marine Corps and a grateful nation.""
The day of the Sept. 11 attacks, Randy was at a Marine Corps school at the base near Quantico, Va. He had been having premonitions—a heads-up from God, he believed—about a terrible event.
Military officers asked students if any spoke Urdu, Arabic, Farsi or Pashto. Randy had studied Arabic in college, but he didn't feel fluent enough to put up his hand. The military decided any Arabic was good enough.
Officials hustled Randy to a Navy office near the Pentagon and told him he would likely be deployed overseas on a secret special-operations mission. ""We suggest you talk to your wife,"" an officer told him.
By mid-2002, Randy was attached to Special Operations Command. He joined about 20 commandos assigned to recruit, train and lead Afghan militiamen who would become the core of an Afghan national guard.
The U.S. military was desperate to learn what was going on in Afghanistan, and Randy was ordered to collect intelligence about who was on whose side in the villages along the country's mountainous border with Pakistan.
The U.S. had overthrown Afghanistan's Taliban regime in 2001 with a few thousand troops and Central Intelligence Agency operatives, as well as an alliance of Afghan militias. The fighting ebbed within months, and few people in the George W. Bush administration called for more forces after the surviving Taliban and their al Qaeda allies fled to Pakistan.
When Randy showed up in Khost province in January 2003, there were fewer than 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
The Bush administration was weeks away from launching a full-scale invasion of Iraq. Afghanistan, if not forgotten, was largely considered won.
Allies abroad
Eastern Afghanistan hosted an eclectic mix of allied troops: Green Berets, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, reconnaissance Marines, regular infantry Marines, 101st Airborne paratroopers, CIA agents, Italian commandos, warlords, militiamen, tribal fighters and Afghan border police.
Randy lived and fought alongside another American for months without asking which secret outfit the man worked for.
While America's attention was on Iraq, fanatical fighters, including Arabs, Chechens and other foreigners, probed Afghanistan's defenses, trying to undo the 2001 defeat of Taliban rule.
Ethnic Pashtuns of eastern and southern Afghanistan made up the Taliban's power base. Randy's job was to persuade the tribesmen to ally with the U.S., and train them to defend the border against al Qaeda and Taliban militants.
He decided against living at a fortified military base and commuting to local villages. The risk of getting blown up on the road was too high. Instead, Randy set up five tented command posts along 60 miles of border, hiking from one to the other.
To woo the Pashtuns, Randy lived as they did. He let his hair and beard grow. He wore a loose Afghan tunic and trousers for meetings with elders. He slept on a mat on the floor of his tent or in the bed of his Toyota pickup. He ate apples and grapes, and broke four teeth on pebbles accidentally baked into local bread.
Randy visited villages to pick up word of roaming Arab fighters. He and other commandos set up impromptu clinics to distribute vaccines, malaria pills and Tylenol.
In villages hostile to the U.S., he handed out crayons and a coloring book he drew. The illustrations and Quranic verses explained why Americans had come to Afghanistan. ""In the year 2001 on the 11 of September, evil and bad people named al Qaeda attacked America,"" read the caption for a sketch of the Twin Towers in flames.
Randy explained to village leaders that al Qaeda had killed 3,000 from his clan. ""I'm here to extract payment for this blood feud,"" he said.
The Pashtuns understood. You've got a blood feud? We get it.
Randy came to rely on the son of a village elder to interpret. When the man was a teenager, his father had sent him to work with a U.K. charity that cleared munitions left by the Soviets when they fled Afghanistan in 1989. The village elder saw an opportunity for the boy to improve his language skills.
The son was 23 when Randy met him, and he spoke British-accented English that was unusually good for someone educated in rural Afghanistan.
He soon became Randy's right hand. He translated when Randy gathered Pashtun warriors on a ridge and drew on a white board to illustrate how to take advantage of the terrain during firefights and how to conduct an ambush.
Randy taught map-reading, using an Afghanistan-shaped piece of peel from a grapefruit to show how a flat map represented part of a round planet.
The American started with a force of 250 village men. By the time he finished his sixth tour in 2005, Randy had trained 3,000. The U.S. paid inexperienced recruits $100 a month, and as much as $250 to a man trained by Soviets in the 1980s to handle explosives.
Enemy fighters wanted to move men and arms through the mountain passes in Afghanistan. The Marine and his Afghans were in the way. Randy's camps were attacked several times a month. Sometimes it was a single shot or a rocket volley. Other times, dozens of al Qaeda fighters tried to overrun his positions.
U.S. attack helicopters could reach Randy and his men in minutes. During the most violent months, he called for help every other day to defend against attackers.
At first, the militants whom Randy and his men killed were Syrian, Yemeni, Sudanese and Chechen. As time went on, al Qaeda militants tried to stay out of danger by sending boys from Pakistani religious schools to set up ambushes and plant booby-traps in dry riverbeds used as roads. The boys hid nearby and triggered the explosives with garage-door openers.
Randy's truck was in the lead on a patrol in 2003 when he stopped to check his radio. His Afghan comrades drove past him and over one of the hidden bombs. Eight men were blown to pieces.
A euphoria filled Randy, a feeling of being more alive than he had ever felt. Then a wave of grief washed away his near-death relief. He couldn't stop thinking about one of the dead, a timid farmer who had volunteered to be a militia commander. Randy had been tough on him, and he wished he had just once told the man he was doing a good job.
In late 2004, Randy and a few trucks carrying his fighters drove down to a base in Jalalabad for fresh food and a break from the fighting. In a valley below, he spotted a convoy of Marine Corps Humvees.
Randy was excited to see some comrades. He found the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Norm Cooling, who eyed the Marine in long hair and beard.
I know that guy from somewhere, the colonel thought. Then it dawned on him. A decade earlier, when he was a company commander, Randy had been one of his most promising young lieutenants.
""Gee, Randy,"" the colonel joked. ""I didn't know you had gotten out of the Marine Corps.""
Lt. Col. Cooling was eager for intelligence. With Iraq drawing the bulk of U.S. combat troops, his 1,000-man battalion had to defend six Afghan provinces encompassing 12,000 square miles. He would hopscotch across eastern Afghanistan and spend a few days with each infantry platoon. It was a hard winter, and he sometimes patrolled the highlands in snowshoes.
Randy's mission was so classified he couldn't even share details with a superior officer. Yet he gave Lt. Col. Cooling a who's-who of local Pashtun tribes.
Manning the radio in the Marine convoy was a 21-year-old corporal named Eric Lueken, from Dubois, Ind. A year earlier, Eric, dissatisfied with working the night shift at a water-treatment plant, had walked into the recruiters office in Evansville, Ind., across from the Goodwill donation center and down the street from a strip club, Regina's House of Dolls.
Eric returned home that night and told his surprised parents he had enlisted. ""I'm leaving in three weeks,"" he said.
Before shipping out to Afghanistan, Eric stopped by the lakeside house of Ken Bohnert, a family friend. They drank beers on the dock, and Ken gave Eric the combat knife from his own years in the Marines. ""You take this with you,"" said Ken, who had joined in 1958. ""You bring it back to me.""
Randy had greeted Eric the day he spotted the Marine convoy, asking the radio operator where to find the commander.
It was a passing moment that gave no hint of the fates at play, that Cpl. Lueken would form a link in a chain of events that changed Randy's life.
Home front
In 2004, Dawn was home in Fredericksburg, Va., with the children, Shawn and Caroline, when she saw Marines in a government van drive by the house. The van made a U-turn and passed again.
Dawn saw it coming—a knock on the door, and uniformed men delivering a regret-to-inform-you. She and Randy had talked about the possibility. She hid behind the curtains and steeled herself for the children's sake.
""Your reaction will be their reaction,"" she told herself.
It turned out the Marines in the van were looking for a lost dog.
Randy's absence and the constant threat of widowhood forced Dawn to become more independent. She managed the couple's rental properties in Quantico and Indiana. Dawn sought friends from church. She imagined moving the family back to Indiana if Randy were killed.
Between combat tours, Randy briefed officials at the Pentagon and then returned home for a few awkward weeks with Dawn. She saw disturbing changes in her husband's personality. He had never been a yeller. Now he was agitated from war and couldn't keep a lid on his volatile moods.
Eager to resume his paternal role, Randy disrupted daily routines that Dawn had worked hard to construct. He blew up with his wife over small things, such as taking his daughter's side in an argument over gym class.
During one visit home, Dawn told him: ""Could you lighten up a little? My friends think you're weird.""
Randy shrugged off Dawn's concerns. He didn't believe in post-traumatic stress disorder. Anyone who complained of it was weak, and Marine officers weren't supposed to show weakness.
After a few trips home, Randy secretly wished he could skip the strained reunions and wrenching farewells and stay in Afghanistan for the duration. Life was simpler at war.
The messenger
Randy felt he had won over the Pashtuns on his stretch of the border and turned them into a weapon to defend Afghanistan and, in turn, America.
Leaving the mountains for the last time in 2005, he worried that the U.S. was failing to secure its early inroads with the Pashtuns. Every villager alienated by a careless raid or an insult was a potential Taliban recruit.
Randy earned the bronze star for his service in Afghanistan. He found it almost embarrassing. The Pashtuns had taken far greater risks on his orders. For many fighters it was a last act that drew no medals. He lost 80 to 100 men over 2½ years, one of them decapitated by a helicopter blade.
Aboard the military transport plane heading home, Randy mourned. ""I loved living with those guys,"" he said.
The Marine Corps returned Randy to Indiana to help train a company of reservists. He and Dawn figured he would retire there after this one last posting. They bought a farmhouse in Ladoga, Ind., population 1,100.
Randy started a small Christmas tree farm. Dawn wanted chickens and a garden. She imagined herself an old lady in braids selling tomatoes from a stand at the end of their driveway.
At the time, the U.S. was consumed by the insurgencies in Iraq unleashed by Saddam Hussein's overthrow. By the end of 2006, U.S. fatalities in Iraq surpassed the number of deaths from Sept. 11.
The U.S. military, short-handed and fighting two wars, sent Reserve and National Guard troops into battle. Randy's job was preparing these part-time warriors—electricians, teachers, cops, prison guards—to fight in Iraq. His men were headed for Fallujah, the site of some of the most vicious urban combat since the Vietnam War.
Iraqi militants, who rarely won face-to-face firefights with American troops, had learned to improvise land mines, burying them along roads or concealing them in buildings.
Advances in booby-trap technology ricocheted from Afghanistan to Iraq and back again. Insurgents fashioned triggers from garage-door openers, cellphones and transmitters for radio-controlled toys. They calibrated pressure-sensitive detonators to explode under the step of a soldier or the wheels of an armored vehicle.
In 2006, Brig. Gen. Bob Neller, deputy commander for operations of Marine forces in Iraq, was struggling to stem the mounting toll of Marines killed or injured by roadside bombs. Each week, he held a meeting to bat around ideas.
Electronic jammers could defeat bombs detonated by radio or phone signals. But there wasn't a reliable way to deal with pressure-sensitive triggers.
Gen. Neller suggested mounting wheeled rollers on the front of Humvees to set off a buried bomb before the vehicle drove over it. Explosives specialists argued against the idea: A bomb set off by a mine roller would spray shrapnel toward the turret gunner, who often rode with head and shoulders exposed.
For a couple of weeks, the general hesitated over a decision. Then he lost another Marine. It was Cpl. Eric Lueken, the radio operator Randy Hoffman had met in Afghanistan two years earlier.
Cpl. Lueken and three other Marines had driven over a bomb hidden on a road running along the Euphrates River. The explosion tore Eric apart; the other Marines survived. When the report of Eric's death landed on Gen. Neller's desk, the general was jolted out of indecision.
At the next meeting on roadside bombs, Gen. Neller ordered engineers to start building mine rollers. ""You've got one week to come up with a prototype,"" he said. Eric Lueken's battalion was the first to test the devices in the field.
In Indiana, Randy's phone rang. As the senior active-duty Marine officer in the area, it fell to him to inform families in parts of Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky that their loved ones had died in combat. The Marine calling from the casualty section told him to deliver the bad news to Eric's parents.
Randy and 1st Sgt. Troy Euclide drove two hours to Dubois. When they got close to the Luekens' home, they stopped at a bathroom at a Subway restaurant to change into their crisply pressed green uniforms.
Melinda and Jake Lueken lived in an A-frame house surrounded by bean fields and turkey farms. Randy and Troy made a reconnaissance pass of the house and saw an American flag and yellow ribbon outside.
After driving by, they stopped on a side road and prayed. ""God, help us give this terrible news to the family,"" Randy said.
It was a Saturday afternoon. Jake and Melinda were about to go to Mass. Melinda knew what was coming when she saw Randy and Troy at the front door.
Randy's words spilled out: ""I'm sorry to tell you Eric was killed yesterday in Iraq.""
""Oh, my God, no,"" Melinda said. She took Eric's boot-camp portrait down from the wall and slumped onto the sofa, hugging the frame to her chest as she rocked back and forth.
The bomb had done such damage to Eric's body that military morticians in Dover, Del., took weeks to prepare it. When Eric's remains finally arrived at the airport in Louisville, Ky., mourners lined the roads to Dubois. High school bands played the Marines' Hymn in towns along the route.
Randy warned the Luekens against holding an open-casket wake or even looking inside. Jake's hand shook as he approached the casket and slipped in some family photos.
The funeral was at St. Raphael Church in Dubois. Marines in dress blue uniforms carried the casket next door to the cemetery.
Over three years of duty in Indiana, Randy buried nine Marines and paid dozens of visits to grieving families. He set up a special ringtone to signal phone calls from the casualty section. He and Dawn jumped whenever it sounded. She hated that ring.
Once alerted, Randy had 24 hours to find next of kin and deliver the news.
There was the widow of Lance Cpl. Josh Hines, a young Marine who had once stood wet-eyed at Randy's desk and asked permission to see his newborn son before leaving for Iraq. Randy let him fly home. Josh was killed by a hidden bomb weeks after arriving in the combat zone.
Randy sat with Josh's widow, Caryn Gilbert, and her baby after visitation at the Methodist church in Casey, Ill. When everyone else had gone, Randy walked her to the coffin so she could hold her husband's hand one final time.
One Marine's father was imprisoned, and a judge gave him special permission to attend the funeral. The man stood at the open casket in an orange jumpsuit.
While Randy was reeling from the barrage of death calls, Dawn and Shawn narrowly avoided catastrophe. In September 2006, they stopped for gas and Dawn told Shawn to wait in the car. Instead, the boy, then 8 years old, followed his mother into the station to look at a car magazine.
Moments later, a drunken driver traveling at close to 100 miles an hour plowed into the gas pumps and ignited a giant fireball.
Dawn and Shawn were inside the minimart while their SUV burned.
Randy was at home pushing Caroline on a swing when he saw the mushroom cloud. His thoughts went first to the booby-trap bombs of Afghanistan.
He hustled Caroline and 2-year-old Emma, their youngest, into the car and sped toward the gas station. Randy desperately searched for Dawn and Shawn, who had escaped through a back door.
For the next two days, Randy felt almost like he was back in combat. His pulse raced and his hands shook. He was constantly alert to threats in the one place he had thought safe.
Randy began drinking, two or three glasses of wine a day, a lot for him. While driving, he sometimes got heart palpitations and tunnel vision.
""It was death notification after death notification,"" Dawn said. ""He couldn't get his head above water.""
Under pressure
One winter day, Shawn and Caroline, bundled in snowsuits, were sliding down the front hill on plaster saucers when some neighborhood boys came by with their own sleds.
Randy heard the older kids swearing. Watching through the window, Dawn saw Randy storm outside, grab one of the boys and scream at him. He lined them up and took their pictures, the same way he photographed captured insurgents in Afghanistan.
""Why?"" Dawn demanded, taking his phone and deleting the photos.
Randy apologized to the boys. When they nervously asked permission to sled in the yard a couple of weeks later, he invited them in for hot chocolate.
At a crowded gas station, Randy was overwhelmed by the smell of diesel, a scent heavy with memories of Afghanistan. He got into a spat with an older woman. ""Get back in your car,"" he yelled.
When he tried to apologize, the woman rebuffed him: ""You're a rude man.""
""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm not usually that way.""
The older children saw that the slightest irritation could set him off. They learned to stifle their sneezes in the car and to wake him gently.
Caroline once wrote ""Dad is scary"" on a piece of paper and hid it in a pink lockbox, where she kept her treasures. Shawn ran off with the note and showed it to their dad.
Randy was horrified. ""You have no reason to be scared of me,"" he told Caroline.
Dawn wondered what had happened to the man she married.
By the end of Randy's three-year posting, Indiana didn't feel like home to him anymore, and he wanted out. Every road brought to mind a mother weeping at a screen door or a shovelful of dirt thumping onto a casket lid.
Dawn wanted to stay close to her family.
The Marine Corps ended the debate in 2008 and ordered Randy back to the Quantico base in Virginia.
Deep in thought
The Bush administration was coming to an end. The Taliban and other insurgent groups were staging the comeback Randy and others had feared. Building and training Afghan security forces progressed slowly.
Mr. Bush believed his troop surge had turned the tide in Iraq, and he tried the same approach in Afghanistan. The 27,000 U.S. troops in the country at the beginning of 2008 had grown to 35,000 when President Obama took office in 2009.
Mr. Obama campaigned on his opposition to the war in Iraq while pointing to Afghanistan as a conflict the U.S. was obliged to fight.
""Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backward,"" Mr. Obama said at a West Point speech in his first year as commander in chief. ""I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops.""
The Marines sent Randy to Command and Staff College, a graduate program at Quantico for promising majors. Immersed in his classes, he reflected on the war, and one moment kept coming to mind.
In 2003, he and a patrol of Green Berets came across the ruins of a training camp in Khost province, where Osama bin Laden had given interviews weeks before al Qaeda's 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. An Army intelligence officer told Randy that he believed bin Laden had begun planning the Sept. 11 attacks there.
The camp was a pile of rubble, destroyed in 1998 by a volley of U.S. cruise missiles in retaliation for the embassy bombings. Investigators believe the airstrike missed bin Laden by a few hours. Randy stuffed three bricks from the ruins into his backpack.
Randy imagined al Qaeda planners working out details to coordinate four suicide hijackings half a world away, a devastating attack on the world's greatest military power by 19 men armed with box cutters.
He pictured bin Laden, who had fought the Soviets in Afghanistan, trying to predict the U.S. response to the attack. Would the U.S. invade Afghanistan? If so, would the Americans fight with the same clumsy brutality that marked the failed 10-year Soviet war? Would the Pashtun rise up against the Americans?
Randy began to think the Afghanistan war was an al Qaeda trap. The jihadist group, he wrote in a research paper, ""understood that by killing thousands of Americans, they would ignite a fierce response that would certainly involve American military forces being deployed to Afghanistan.""
He suspected al Qaeda had lured the U.S. to Afghanistan, hoping the Americans would end up, like the Soviets, humiliated by Pashtun resistance. Some in Washington held a similar belief.
Hard choice
At the end of the school year in 2009, Randy and his class heard a presentation on post-traumatic stress disorder. As a speaker listed the symptoms, Randy fought the urge to race out of the auditorium. During a break, he fled to the men's room and dry-heaved.
Afterward, he found his faculty adviser. ""I have to share something,"" he said. Randy sat at a table with classmates and, for 90 minutes, unloaded stories of trauma that he couldn't contain any longer. ""Something is going to happen to me,"" he said.
A nurse, Kim Bradley, listened at the table. She assisted troops suffering from PTSD for a military charity. Randy, she thought, was a textbook case. She handed him her business card. ""Call me if you need anything,"" she said.
Randy moved on to the School of Advanced Warfighting, a selective program that takes officers to visit the world's battlefields. He traveled to Salerno, Italy, to study the World War II amphibious landings. He walked around Wake Island and Peleliu in the Pacific, and Huê City and Khe Sanh, in Vietnam.
By then, Randy's friends knew he was struggling with anxiety and depression. The Marine Corps still saw him as an officer with an extraordinary record of combat and academic achievement.
In July 2009, the Marines announced Randy would be promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, known since Vietnam as the Magnificent Bastards.
In Afghanistan, Mr. Obama's troop escalation was gaining steam. By the war's peak in 2010 and 2011, more than 100,000 U.S. troops would be deployed there. The 1,000-man battalion offered to Randy was headed for Musa Qala, a district of fertile river flats and bone-dry desert in Helmand province, the world's largest source of opium poppies.
The prospect of leading men into battle sent Randy into a panic. He stayed in bed for three days. He woke up every four hours, as he had in Afghanistan, alert to any attack. He lost his appetite and was short of breath.
Randy stopped showing up at school. He felt like he was unraveling in front of everyone at a time when admitting to post-traumatic stress would almost certainly end a Marine Corps career.
Dawn was too worried about Randy's collapse to fret about his job. Screw the Marine Corps, she thought. I don't care who knows. I want this fixed.
She called the school's director, Col. Tracy King. He had noticed Randy's sullen attitude and the dark bags under his eyes that made it look like he had lost a bar fight. Col. King and his wife began visiting the Hoffman house to check on Randy.
Dawn rifled through Randy's wallet for the business card of Kim Bradley, the nurse. She called, desperate for help.
Kim set up appointments for Randy with a therapist at Fort Belvoir, Va. A medical team there diagnosed him with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, and doctors prescribed drugs for anxiety and depression.
Randy came clean with one of his oldest Marine Corps friends, Kirk Mullins. Randy and Kirk had been enlisted men who made the jump to officers together.
""Dude, I'm not doing well,"" Randy said. He looked haggard and distraught, and he couldn't explain what was happening.
If this can occur to Randy, there's not a single one of us who isn't susceptible, thought Kirk.
He worried that Randy was too agitated to drive. Randy didn't trust himself behind the wheel, either. For the rest of the summer, Kirk drove his friend to Fort Belvoir and sat in the waiting room during therapy sessions.
On their way home one day, Randy confessed: ""I'm in no condition to lead Marines, and I don't know when I'm going to be in that position, if ever.""
Kirk knew that refusing command would likely end Randy's career. He urged his friend not to rush into a decision.
Randy also told Col. King his doubts about commanding troops in Afghanistan. The colonel escorted Randy to talk to Gen. Neller, who had been promoted to major general and named head of Marine Corps schools at Quantico.
""Sir, I'm considering declining command,"" Randy said. ""I'm concerned that I will let my Marines down.""
Gen. Neller, who had lost 314 troops in Iraq from 2006 through 2007, including Cpl. Lueken, was sympathetic.
""All of us came back from Iraq and Afghanistan different than when we left,"" the general said. He urged Randy to take a few months to decide and to give him an answer after Christmas.
Over the holidays, Randy convinced himself he could do it all: Keep a lid on his post-traumatic stress and lead Marines in combat. The couple returned to Quantico to tell Col. King that Randy was ready to lead the Magnificent Bastards.
Seeing Dawn during their meeting, Col. King recalled his own wife's dismay years earlier, when she had found herself saddled with the duties of the commander's spouse. He warned Dawn that her husband's assignment would be a two-person job: While Randy was in Afghanistan, she would be expected to comfort lonely wives, help troubled children and console grieving families. At the same time, Dawn's own mother was dying of cancer.
Randy read resignation on Dawn's face.
That afternoon, he returned alone to Col. King's office and turned down the job. ""I want the Marines to have a battalion commander who's in the game,"" Randy said.
Dawn was fixing dinner when Randy came home and told her.
""What are they going to do with us now?"" she asked.
The return
To Randy's surprise, Gen. Neller worked to keep him in the Marine Corps. The general arranged for him to serve two years as deputy director of the School of Advanced Warfighting.
As soon as Randy felt stable, Gen. Neller told him, he could apply again for command. ""In my opinion, you did everything we ask our Marine officers to do,"" the general said. ""I'm not going to punish that.""
Share Your Thoughts
In what ways does Randy Hoffman's story resonate with you? Join the discussion below.
As word spread, Randy's decision stunned Marines. It was the first time they had seen an officer decline battalion command because of post-traumatic stress, and, even more surprising to them, continue to advance.
It was a turning point for Randy—and for the Marine Corps. About 15% of those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq returned home with post-traumatic stress symptoms, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Col. King, now a major general, said Randy's honesty led the Marines to become more accepting of the emotional damage that war inflicts on those who fight. He has told Randy's story to hundreds of young officers.
Having disclosed his own secret, Randy preached mental health to other Marines. After one presentation at a veterans retreat in the Pennsylvania woods, two vets told Randy they had planned to kill themselves. His talk, they said, changed their minds.
A Vietnam vet grabbed his arm and said he wished someone had delivered Randy's talk to him in 1969.
""How are you doing now?"" Randy asked.
The man reached into his pocket and pulled out pink antianxiety pills. Randy showed him two pink pills of his own.
As part of his teaching duties, Randy escorted a group of officers on a tour to Huê, Vietnam, where he came across a celebration of war veterans. Children sang to the elderly North Vietnamese soldiers in their old uniforms.
Randy posed for a photo with two veterans who had fought against U.S. Marines in 1968. One had lost a leg; the other had been badly burned.
Randy's pedicab driver, a former South Vietnamese marine, waited in the parking lot, left out of the festivities for having fought on the losing side. He had survived a re-education camp and now could find only menial work. Randy worried about his Pashtun fighters should the U.S. pull out of Afghanistan.
By 2012, Randy felt stable, and he again put his name in for battalion command. Such assignments are determined by a panel of 21 generals and colonels in secret deliberations.
When Randy's name came up, the debate was heated. ""There were some officers in the room who couldn't get past the stigma that he had declined his first selection for command,"" said Lt. Col. C.J. Williams, Randy's former commander in Indiana, now a full colonel.
Randy's supporters prevailed, and the Corps gave him command of 750 Marines who taught leadership to new lieutenants at a school in Quantico. He created and led a course on combat stress and filled in the curriculum with details of his own struggle.
Some of his students had already served in Afghanistan or Iraq as enlisted Marines before becoming officers, and the relatively slow pace at Quantico gave their troubles a chance to blister to the surface.
Alarmed wives began calling Dawn about their husbands. Randy made sure they contacted Kim Bradley, the nurse, for help.
In 2012, Gen. Joe Dunford, then-assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, visited Quantico for Mess Night, a traditional dinner where Marines donned evening dress uniforms and ate prime rib roast and Yorkshire pudding. Ending the meal, the Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual dictates ""a savory, rather than a sweet dessert is served, as the latter spoils the taste of the port.""
Randy sat next to Gen. Dunford at the head table. They had served together aboard the USS Whidbey Island in the Mediterranean in 1987. Randy was a young corporal on a reconnaissance team. Then-Capt. Dunford was a company commander who noticed Randy's expertise with weapons.
Now, as assistant commandant, Gen. Dunford focused on how the Corps cared for its wounded, including those with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress. When they dined at Mess Night, he already knew Randy's story.
""It's officers like Randy who have encouraged others to come forward, get treatment and have confidence when they did get treatment that their professional careers wouldn't suffer as a result,"" Gen. Dunford said.
At dinner, their talk was all about Afghanistan. Gen. Dunford didn't let on that within a few days Mr. Obama would name him commander of U.S. and allied forces there.
When the nomination became public, Randy sent the general an email: ""I'd like to go."" He sought to ease any concerns about his post-trauma stress, referring instead to his ""post-traumatic growth."" In part, though, Randy wanted to return to Afghanistan to see if he had fully put his trauma behind him.
Gen. Dunford had extensive combat experience in Iraq but had never served in Afghanistan. Before shipping out in early 2013, the general had lunch with Randy and took notes, peppering him with questions about Pashtuns on the Pakistan border.
Months later, Gen. Dunford invited Randy to join his planning staff in Kabul.
The city in 2013 didn't resemble the Afghanistan of a decade earlier. The nimble commando campaign that followed the Sept. 11 attacks had stalled behind concrete blast walls and checkpoints. Randy visited Jalalabad, where the outpost had grown into a sprawling U.S. base with a coffee shop and souvenir stands.
Mr. Obama was looking for an exit and had scaled U.S. forces back to 68,000 troops by the end of the 2012 warm-weather fighting season. Under the president's plan, the U.S. presence would drop to 10,000 troops by the end of 2014, leaving the U.S.-trained Afghan military to battle the Taliban. U.S. special operators and American air power would hunt al Qaeda and other terror groups.
Hundreds of U.S. bases and outposts were bulldozed, closed or turned over to the Afghans. Among his jobs, Randy had to figure out how to move out a decade's worth of war materiel.
Insurgents were spreading havoc with high-profile bombings and attacks. In 2014, they sneaked weapons into the Serena Hotel in Kabul, a popular spot for expatriates, and killed nine people.
From his perch near Gen. Dunford, Randy better appreciated the war's complexity. What seemed like a simple path to victory—fight hard, show respect and win Pashtun allies—wasn't so easy to achieve amid the ethnic hodgepodge of Afghanistan. Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Nuristanis, Hazaras and others had competing agendas. The violent rivalry between India and Pakistan played out on Afghan soil.
Randy wondered if he had been too harsh in his impatience with the U.S. approach.
During a foray out of Kabul, an obliging helicopter pilot flew Randy over the ridges and valleys where he had lost many friends. The contours of the Spīn Ghar range were still carved deep into his memory.
At the time, a charity was bringing veterans of the Afghan war back to visit places where they had fought. The men had been carried off the battlefield on stretchers; now they returned with prosthetic limbs and disfiguring burns, seeking emotional healing to match their physical recovery.
Staff at Gen. Dunford's headquarters turned out to applaud the arriving vets, and the general spoke with each of them. Randy wrote briefing cards for the general that detailed each man's injuries and progress toward recovery. He arranged the group's travel to villages, mountainsides and farm fields.
""I knew how they felt coming back,"" Randy said. ""It was almost like medicine to me.""
When Randy packed for home in 2014, Gen. Dunford, who recently retired after serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a short speech.
Randy's return to Afghanistan, the general said, ""was good for him, a little closure.""
Back stateside
For years, Gen. Neller dwelled on Cpl. Lueken's death and his own initial reluctance to order mine rollers to protect his men. In 2014, he had Eric's name and the date of his death engraved on a black metal bracelet. The following year, Gen. Neller rose to commandant, the top officer in the Marine Corps.
Jake Lueken, Eric's father, heard about the bracelet and sent word that he wanted to talk. Gen. Neller took a week or so to get up the nerve to call. When he did, he told Jake about his hesitation to order mine rollers until Eric's death spurred him to action.
In 2016, a decade after Eric died, Gen. Neller traveled to Indiana to meet Jake and Melinda, as well as the family of another fallen Marine. The general wanted to comfort the Luekens, but he didn't know what to say. Their hourslong drive together from the airport to Dubois was filled with uneasy silences.
During their visit to St. Raphael cemetery, Gen. Neller knelt in the grass, balled his fist and hit Eric's polished black-granite marker. ""Sorry, Eric, it took me so long to get here,"" he said.
Time revealed a series of connections among Randy, Gen. Neller, Lt. Col. Cooling and the Luekens. Gen. Neller realized that Randy's breakdown had been sparked, in part, by the visit to tell the Luekens that Eric had been killed. Randy learned that Gen. Neller, the man who had saved his career and perhaps his sanity, was himself haunted by Eric's death.
Randy stayed at the Luekens' house during a later visit by Gen. Neller to Indiana in 2017. Looking at family photos with Melinda, Randy realized for the first time that Eric was the same radio man he had met on the road to Jalalabad early in the war.
The next day, Lt. Col. Cooling—Eric's commander in Afghanistan and Iraq—visited the St. Raphael cemetery with Randy and the Luekens. Over dinner, Lt. Col. Cooling, by then a brigadier general, told Jake and Melinda that mine rollers had saved many lives since Eric's death.
In 2017, Randy was promoted to full colonel. He moved his family to the Marine Corps boot camp set among the swamps and palmetto trees on Parris Island, S.C.
From there, Randy would drive to see his therapist in Savannah, Ga.
On Good Friday this spring, his need to talk turned urgent. His longtime friend, Lt. Col. Brett Hart, had arrived early at his Arizona office that day and posted a sign on the door warning people to stay out. Then he killed himself.
Dawn had gone to high school with Brett's wife, Molly Hart, and had set up the couple on their first date.
Brett, a helicopter pilot, was days from retirement when he died. Randy and Kirk Mullins had planned to attend the ceremony. Instead, they traveled to his funeral.
They hadn't told Brett they were coming to celebrate his retirement. It was to be a surprise. ""I shouldn't have dodged his calls,"" Randy later told his therapist. He sat on the couch, head in hands.
Randy went back on antianxiety medication. He admitted to his therapist that he had thought about how he might kill himself.
The Marines under Randy's command taught combat skills to new recruits, who were often straight out of high school.
The young men and women arrived by bus after dark and lined up on yellow footprints painted on the pavement. The men's heads were shaved, and everyone's possessions were locked up. Their individuality was stripped away by drill instructors charged with recasting them into disciplined Marines. They quickly learned to refer to themselves in the third person.
Near the rifle range, Randy gathered 160 male recruits one day this summer and asked what they remembered of
Sept. 11, 2001
.
""This recruit was in fourth grade, he believes, when it happened,"" one said. ""This recruit's teacher stepped out of class and came back teary-eyed.""
One recruit was born on Jan. 14, 2002. At boot camp, new Marines are so young that history instructors teach them about the Sept. 11 attacks that started the Afghanistan war.
The young men sat rapt, eating their box lunches, as Randy described what it was like to kill. ""Your heart rate is uncontrollable,"" he said. ""Your pulse goes up so much that your ears kind of stop up. Everything goes kind of in slow motion. Your brain focuses on minute details to help you get through engaging the enemy before he can kill you.""
He passed around what appeared to be a heavy pen and told its story.
He and his Afghan fighters were driving into a market near Jalalabad in 2004, an area thick with al Qaeda and Taliban. A teenager on a moped slowly passed Randy's pickup truck, smiling as he went by. One of Randy's militiamen leapt out of the truck and tackled the boy. Two Afghan policemen joined the melee and pummeled the teen with their rifles.
As Randy tried to separate them, the Afghans ripped open the boy's shirt, revealing a hand grenade. The boy also had the pen, which turned out to be a disguised single-shot, .22-caliber pistol.
""We are training you with a deadly skill so you can come home alive and you can bring those other Marines with you,"" Randy told the recruits. ""Do you understand me?""
""YESSIR,"" they responded in unison.
Then Randy revealed that he had been in and out of therapy for more than a decade. ""I'm not embarrassed to tell you,"" he said. Combat, he added, ""takes a mental and emotional toll on any human being.""
Small victories
Weeks later, Randy began what will likely be his last tour in the Marines, running the regional Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps out of Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Fla.
He has decorated his office with memories: the bricks from bin Laden's camp in Khost; photos of his father, his Uncle Gary and his late Uncle Terry, all in Marine uniforms; a set of bottles containing soil and stones from Chancellorsville, Iwo Jima, Troy, Verdun, Weiyuan Fort and other long-ago battlefields.
The Hoffmans' youngest, 15-year-old Emma, jokes that if she inherits her dad's dirt collection, she will bury it with him.
Hoffmanistan is quieter, if not fully at peace.
Randy, 53, sinks into anxiety some days but not many. He has had two shoulder operations and fought off a bout of skin cancer that he blames on years of sun in the Afghan mountains. He has an eye injury from a scuba training accident. He wears hearing aids to compensate for damage from an ammunition-dump explosion.
""There is an edge to his personality that he didn't used to have,"" said Dawn, 49. ""I don't think that PTSD ever goes away. But there is healing that springs from that.""
""I was not prepared for that emotional toll,"" Randy said, looking back on a life at war. ""That's what crushed my soul.""
Yet he feels more contented than he has since before Sept. 11 and rarely needs the pink antianxiety pills.
Randy will probably retire at the end of his tour in Tallahassee, with nearly four decades of service.
He tracks Afghanistan peace negotiations and wonders if the Marines he trains will fight in the same mountains he did. He fears the war will end like Vietnam, with Americans again abandoning those who fought by their side.
He also thinks about the brotherhood he felt with his Afghan fighters; the Pashtun villagers who survived childhood because of medical care from American commandos; the way the Marine Corps stood by him.
""Even if the outcome is not good,"" he said, ""I still have those small wins, and that's what I hang onto.""
Dawn has turned her nurse's training into a career helping troops come home. She fields calls at all hours from troubled vets and worried spouses. The wife of an Afghanistan vet phoned last year to say her husband had been on a bender for days. Dawn tracked down another veteran who went to the couple's house, took the vet to an emergency room and then enrolled him in an alcohol-abuse program run by the VA.
She was taught early in life that family problems should be kept hidden. She grew up in a small Indiana town, she said, ""where as long as the image of everyone was good, that was kind of OK with everybody.""
Randy's war made it impossible for her to conceal her family's troubles. Surviving them has given Dawn a but-for-the-grace-of-God understanding of human foibles and more compassion for others facing their own trials.
""For me, it's just been a huge shift in perspective in life,"" she said.
The Hoffman children weren't the only kids growing up in their military neighborhoods whose father came home damaged. Shawn, 22, and Caroline, 20, are in college. These days they take their father's flare-ups less personally.
""He's fighting this invisible battle all the time,"" Caroline said.
Emma, a ninth-grader, missed the worst times. She plans to join the Marines. ""I've grown up very proud of my dad,"" she said. The teen recognizes the risk of post-traumatic stress, but says there is therapy for that.
Randy thinks Emma would make an excellent Marine. Dawn hopes she changes her mind.

Peppy Dubno worked for 23 years for a large financial-services company in New York. And during that time, she didn't tell anybody her age.
Ms. Dubno, who retired last year at 70 as a vice president specializing in data and information architecture, didn't talk about when she went to college or other life events that might reveal her age. She didn't correct colleagues who thought she was far younger, because of her proficiency in technology and because she's fit and very youthful looking with shoulder-length light brown hair.
She knew she was highly regarded by her bosses and colleagues. But she worried about fitting in to a workplace where many employees are in their twenties and managers two or three decades younger than her. ""I didn't want anyone to think of me as their parents' age,"" she says.
Employees in their 50s, 60s and 70s, though outnumbered by millennials, are the only group whose labor-force participation rates are growing. Yet they are the least visible in offices, retail outlets and other workplaces. That is because many conceal their ages. Worried they'll be avoided or rejected by younger managers and co-workers, they often go to great lengths to try to appear younger -- by doing such things as getting cosmetic surgery, shortening their work histories on social-media accounts and in conversations, not citing past accomplishments and not displaying photographs of their grandchildren.
""Older employees are in the closet today in much the same way gay employees used to be,"" says Ruth Finkelstein, director of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College. ""There's pressure to pretend not to be aging in order to succeed while aging -- and employers who don't celebrate their contributions or give them opportunities for new assignments and promotions as they do young talent are complicit in this deception.""
Such internalized ageism is rampant, with many baby boomers dreading being called ""old,"" fearing it will undermine their ability to be accepted and compete in workplaces where youth is prized. They worry they'll be stereotyped as unable to learn new things or understand technology, or considered slow, old-fashioned, too costly and likely to become ill -- and subsequently denied promotions and raises or laid off.
Their fears aren't unfounded. About 56% of U.S. workers who are 50 or older are pushed out of jobs before they plan to retire, and only one in 10 who find new work ever again earn as much, according to a recent study by Urban Institute economist Richard Johnson. Although it is illegal for employers to discriminate against workers, it is difficult to prove; employees must show they lost a job or didn't get an assignment solely because of their age.
Michael Snizek, a 63-year-old financial-services-products manager, was among 15 employees laid off in 2017. Earlier in his career he worked at such companies as Merrill Lynch and UBS Financial Services, he has learned that disclosing his college graduation date on a job interview ""is a disqualifier,"" as is mentioning jobs that go back more than 15 or 20 years.
""I've never felt better in my life, plus now that my kids are grown, I have more time to jump on a plane and be away from home for long stretches of time,"" says Mr. Snizek, who last year made 15 trips to Copenhagen as a consultant to a company. ""Too many employers think that if you're older, you'll never be able to stay awake after 7 p.m.,"" says Mr. Snizek.
As he looks for new employment, he has adopted a youthful image. He carries a backpack instead of a briefcase, has discarded his old leather shoes for a trendier, two-tone pair of Allbirds, and asks his daughter what podcasts and Netflix shows she and her friends like most so he can converse easily with young managers.
Patti Temple Rocks knows how tough it can be for older workers. Now 60, she was moved from an executive position at a Chicago-based communications company last year to a less influential job, despite having received strong performance reviews, she says. ""I felt devalued when I least expected it -- when I felt I was at the height of my skills and knowledge,"" says Ms. Rocks. When she told her boss she wasn't happy with her new position, he asked, ""How long do you plan on working anyway?"" she says. (Ms. Rocks's ex-company declines to comment on her tenure.) She left the company, wrote ""I'm Not Done,"" a book about ageism in the workplace, and now is as chief client officer at ICF Next in Chicago, a unit of ICF International.
""They wanted me for my experience, which makes them the exception,"" she says.
Concealing one's age is stressful and takes a psychological toll. ""If you're in hiding, you're never fully present and you're worried about being found out,"" says Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University who has studied and written about aging, decision making and mindfulness.
Employees who are afraid to talk honestly about themselves and the knowledge they have accumulated over long careers are apt to lose confidence and withdraw, says Ms. Langer, 72. This, in turn, can result in them being overlooked and excluded from strategy meetings or social gatherings -- precisely what they need to avoid happening if they want to keep working.
Employers go along with the secrecy by avoiding conversations about employees' ages and tenure. They worry that if they inquire about or mention anyone's age, they'll be accused of discrimination. Just 8% of CEOs surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2015 said their diversity and inclusion strategies included a conversation about age.
""There hasn't yet been a groundswell of consciousness-raising about age the way there is about gender, race and sexual preference,"" says Kathleen Christensen, director of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's working longer project, which researches older Americans' employment patterns.
This is likely to change as the labor force gets grayer and employers increasingly need to use older employees. About 27% of 65- to 74-year-olds had full- or part-time jobs in 2016, and by 2026, 30% are expected to be employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2030, Americans who are 65 and older will outnumber those 18 and younger.
""The demographics will help older employees come out -- if only because there will be so many of them -- and force companies to better leverage their experience,"" says Joe Casey, an executive coach at Retirement Wisdom in Princeton, N.J., and a former human-resources manager at Merrill Lynch.
For now, though, many older employees think they are prudent to conceal their ages. When a 73-year-old program director at a nonprofit in New York overheard her millennial colleagues talking about the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock music festival, she restrained herself from telling them she'd been there. She regularly gets Botox injections to smooth wrinkles and steps away from her office cubicle when she needs to make a doctor's appointment, because she doesn't want to be overheard providing her date of birth. Although her boss has encouraged her to keep working, she worries younger colleagues who learn her age will complain that she should vacate her position for one of them to fill.
Older employees need a ""come-out-about-age"" campaign, says Ms. Finkelstein of the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging, who tells everyone she works with and meets through her job that she's 65. ""Staying in the closet and going through contortions to try to appear younger makes it harder to change the belief that you can't be old and still working effectively,"" she says.
