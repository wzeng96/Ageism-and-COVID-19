"COLUMN ONE; 24 hours in the heart of a crisis; This is what a shift entails for firefighters of skid row's Station No. 9, where safeguarding L.A.'s most vulnerable can be a Sisyphean task",Los Angeles Times,"Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitA man in tan cargo shorts is lying on the pavement, turning gray with his shirt pulled up to his chest.
An ambulance from Los Angeles Fire Department Station No. 9 shoots down an alley and comes to a stop. Firefighters Brian George and Nicolas Calkins pop out and grab an assortment of medical gear.
""It's probably heroin, dude,"" George says to Calkins, even before kneeling.

They get to work.
""He's breathing,"" Calkins says.
""Narcan?""
""Yeah. I think heroin.""
George checks the man's pulse while Calkins looks for a vein. The man is not breathing well. They inject naloxone, often referred to by the brand name Narcan, into his neck to counteract the overdose. It doesn't work.
George, Calkins and their colleagues respond to thousands of calls like this every month while working at one of the busiest fire stations in the nation, in the heart of one of the most troubled places in Los Angeles: skid row. They are the unlikely rank and file on the front lines of California's escalating homelessness crisis.
The roughly 60 firefighters at Station No. 9 regularly respond to everything from epileptic seizures and overdoses to stalled elevators and full-fledged fires, crisscrossing a district defined by extreme poverty and powerlessness alongside extreme wealth and power in downtown L.A. With residents who are often victims of crime, crippled by addiction and psychiatric disorders from years of living on the street, the firefighters do the best they can with the little they have to offer. Yet the needs are overwhelming.
In 2019 alone, Station No. 9 logged nearly 22,800 emergency calls across just 1.28 square miles -- about 7,500 more than the city's next-busiest station.
Taking care of L.A.'s most vulnerable residents has given these firefighters a unique perspective on the homelessness crisis. Most are empathetic. Some feel isolated or frustrated about the city's inability to fix what's happening outside their front door. But rather than dwell on those larger forces or their feelings about it all, they train constantly and joke around with a camaraderie shaped by their shared commitment to one of the city's most intense jobs.
""We see things that people never see in their lifetimes -- we'll see multiple times in one day,"" said Ian Soriano, a firefighter and apparatus operator at Station No. 9.
This is 24 hours at a skid row fire station.

5:30 a.m.: Fire Station No. 9
Just before sunrise that day, Dan Martinez pulled his Audi A4 onto the sidewalk outside Station No. 9 at 7th and San Julian streets.
The area around the station is abuzz for so much of the day. But at 5:30 a.m., when the C shift arrives, it's quiet. Martinez, who planned to work 48 hours straight, was the first to show up.
A few minutes later, Jacob Gibson, an attendant on one of the station's ambulances, came in and started prepping a meal for the 19 firefighters on duty. Tall with curly red hair and a round face, the second-generation firefighter joked about what he thought was the hardest part of his job.
""Cooking for this many people is a pain in the ass,"" he said.
Gibson began to cut peppers and whisk eggs as the shift change kicked into high gear. Members of the B shift ambled down from their quarters as members of the C shift lined up their cars in the parking lot next door and waited to cram them behind the station.
--
5:39 a.m.: Outside the station
An elderly homeless man walks by wearing a faded gray sweatshirt. He stops and turns toward a firefighter.
""My flesh is on fire,"" he says. ""Put me out.""
""You're not on fire,"" Capt. Branden Silverman responds.
The man keeps walking.
Most of C shift is in the station by 6:30 a.m., but if firefighters don't arrive even earlier, by 5:45 a.m., others will give them hell. Each member has a job to do. In the morning, they check the gear they'll be using that day, and situate their pants and boots near the firetruck they'll be riding in, so they can move quickly when a call comes in.

7:35 a.m.: 632 St. Vincent Court
The man in tan cargo shorts is lying on the pavement, his skin gray.
Calkins, trying to reverse the effects of a heroin overdose, finally finds another vein in the man's arm and asks for another dose of naloxone.
""If you do it, just go half,"" George says.
George rubs the man's chest and pulls him by his pants onto a gurney. Soon afterward, the man is alert in the ambulance and on his way to an emergency room.
Station No. 9 responds to more medical calls like this than any other fire station in the city, according to the LAFD.
Over nearly two years beginning in 2018, almost 14% of the people that the LAFD took to emergency rooms citywide were homeless. That works out to roughly 81 homeless people a day. For Station No. 9, that ratio was 59%, or about 12 homeless people being brought to the ER every day.
Sometimes firefighters administer naloxone by intraosseous infusion, in which a hole is drilled just below the knee and the drug is injected directly into the patient's bone marrow. This is the quickest way to bring someone back from an overdose.
There's a futility in this ritual, though.
On skid row, these firefighters have watched homelessness grow, with the citywide population topping 36,000 as of last year. They've seen drug addiction rob many of those same people of their health, making it harder to achieve a stable future away from the street. Yet all George or Calkins or anyone else at Station No. 9 can really do is take them to the emergency room.
Firefighters say they've noticed that overdoses often occur when a person with a history of drug addiction gets out of prison or jail and thinks he or she has the same tolerance for heroin as in the past.
""You think your body is used to it,"" George said. ""You OD a lot quicker.""
In an effort to reduce the workload, the LAFD recently launched its Sober Unit to transport intoxicated people to a center on skid row. Also, a modified wildland firefighting truck known as a ""fast-response vehicle,"" or FRV, now prowls downtown responding to calls.
The department has heavily publicized these pilot programs. The problem is neither operates on weekends.
""They really push the FRV units,"" Capt. Raymond Robles said, ""but we're here every day.""
--
8:15 a.m.: Back at home base
By 8:15 a.m., the C shift had received 10 calls for help. In the previous 30 minutes, there had been five, nearly all of them on skid row.
Returning to the station, Gibson trudged back to the stove.
""I hope they didn't burn anything,"" he said, knowing that he'd hear it if his fellow firefighters weren't pleased with their burritos. ""All right,"" he said a few minutes later, ""breakfast is ready. Come and get it.""
The station's 19-member C shift -- all of them men -- assembled in the kitchen. Capt. Larry Salas ran through the schedule for the week.
It's a challenge to keep Station No. 9 fully staffed. Some firefighters blame the stigma of homelessness in their district. The volume of calls and the intensity of the work mean firefighters looking for easy overtime aren't flocking there.
As a result, on the day The Times visited, one firefighter was working for his fifth straight day.
After roll call, Robles, the station's longtime leader, took over the meeting. An affable and stocky man, he is part father and part camp counselor to his cohort of younger firefighters, who are intensely loyal to him.
""We're going to go to the Hotel Baltimore and throw the stick,"" he told the team, referring to practice climbing the ladder. ""Everyone is going to climb the stick and work our way down.""
Next to speak is Tony Navarro, who, as the most senior member of Station No. 9, is the bull firefighter. He has been at the station for 11 years; before working there, he'd never seen skid row.
On his first day, Navarro responded to a medical call to find a man without feet in a wheelchair. His legs were wrapped in plastic, and maggots were eating away the flesh underneath. When he and other firefighters pulled the man out of his chair, they found that his whole backside was raw and maggots were crawling over his body, top to bottom.
""It smelled like a dead body,"" Navarro said. ""That was my first day, and it was all downhill from there.""
Burnout is the biggest enemy of trying to be an effective firefighter at Station No. 9, he said. The constant calls, constant horror and constant fatigue add up to high turnover. He recalled dozing off at the wheel several times on his commute home. More than once, he said, California Highway Patrol officers pulled him over.
These days, Navarro said, he finds time to kick his feet up and clear his head by sleeping for a few minutes or watching a movie. Finding those quiet moments is important, he said. Otherwise you won't make it through the day -- physically or emotionally.
For many members of the station, responding to calls in ambulances is the hardest part. ""You're inundated with patients,"" Navarro said. ""It gets to you.""
Of Station No. 9's roughly 22,800 emergency calls last year, about 18,850 were medical, according to the LAFD.
""Half of us wouldn't want to be here if it was just that,"" Navarro said.

9:46 a.m.: 501 S. Los Angeles St., Baltimore Hotel
Two engines and one ladder pull out of Station No. 9 and enter the heat and traffic of a Saturday morning in downtown Los Angeles. The long truck comes to a stop on 5th Street and blocks a lane of traffic.
The truck's ladder rises and settles next to the building's roof. The men line up to climb and discuss how to carry gear up the ladder.
""The most dangerous part is the transition,"" Navarro says.
Two years ago, during a training exercise at a building a lot like the Baltimore Hotel, a member of Station No. 9 -- Kelly Wong -- lost his footing and fell from the ladder onto a firetruck below. He died two days later.
Firefighters are quick to say they do this work for guys like Wong, whose photo is everywhere in the station. They're less willing to talk about what happened on that day.
Soriano, the apparatus operator, worked the same shift as Wong but was off the day his colleague fell. He had been driving to a wine festival with his girlfriend but turned around and headed to the hospital when he heard what had happened.
""A lot of the guys were really good friends with Kelly. Seeing them broken was terrible. If we don't get an opportunity to practice this scenario,"" he said, referring to climbing the ladder, ""we'll be in trouble when there's a more stressful scenario when someone is hanging out a window and a fire is blazing. We have to do it, man. We do it in memory of him.""
Soriano has been with the LAFD for 13 years and with Station No. 9 for four years. After responding to dozens of calls for several days in a row, the grim nature of the work sometimes blurs together.
""It wears on your patience, because a lot of the homeless people, we know them by name, and they're doing the same thing over and over,"" he said. ""We take a guy to the hospital and he'll be right back out at 2 p.m. There's a shock when you first get there and you have to learn how to deal with that over and over again.""
Embracing stoicism, Soriano said, helps him deal with the perpetual stress.
--
1:38 p.m.: 300 Santa Fe Ave.
Firetrucks and an ambulance scream through skid row on their way to an apartment building. A man has fallen six floors after taking a wrong step while fixing an HVAC system on the roof.
The firefighters find him moaning , face down in a pool of blood. His arms and legs point in unnatural directions.
Gibson runs over and kneels down, attempting to get a pulse and sense of the severity of the man's injuries. The man's moans grow louder as the firefighters contemplate how to get him onto a gurney.
""It's going to be uncomfortable no matter what,"" Gibson says, cutting off the man's shirt.
Another firefighter grabs him by his pants and helps flip him over.
""He broke a lot of things,"" Gibson says.
--
6 p.m.: A quiet moment
As 6 p.m. approached, Gibson prepared dinner. While waiting, firefighters cleaned the station, tinkered with faltering exhaust pipes and examined a new ram bar, a firefighting tool for breaking through locks, doors and walls.
In this quiet moment, Michael Villata, an 11-year LAFD veteran, said he's often thinking about the disorder that surrounds Station No. 9.
He said he and his colleagues know rising rents have contributed to the growing number of people living on the street. But he also blames the nexus of mental illness and drug abuse, and what he sees as a hesitancy among L.A. police officers to deal with homeless people and their encampments.
In some cases, Villata speculated, the breakdown of families has left people without the support they need to be successful in life.
Skid row can be dangerous. Firefighters said they have been threatened while responding to calls. Homeless people have brandished knives, and others have picked up shovels to swing at them.
""We've been punched, spit at, choked,"" Robles said.
Specific procedures for dealing with such incidents exist, but they still happen often enough that firefighters say they worry about ending up in a violent confrontation when responding to calls. It doesn't stop them from caring for people on skid row, though.
Villata said he tries to support homeless people -- one man in particular, who goes by the name Mango and lives in a tent across the street from Station No. 9.
Mango moved to Los Angeles from Florida and has become the firefighters' greatest champion -- often wearing a T-shirt or a hat with Station No. 9's logo. Sometimes he helps clean up after a fire is extinguished, and when gear gets stolen from trucks, Mango is usually the one who will venture out to find it.
More often, he stops by just to hang out and talk with the firefighters.
Over the summer, Villata rebuilt Mango's motorbike, but it was stolen days after he delivered it.
""When I gave him the bike, he cried. He was really happy.... I saw him a few days later and he was devastated that it got stolen,"" Villata said. ""I just felt horrible for Mango because of how grateful and happy he was. To have something taken from him -- just watching it sucks.""
--
6:48 p.m.: Station No. 9 TV room
Navarro's feet are up and his eyelids are drooping. A movie is playing on the big screen as a homeless man walks into the station.
""If I could just get some sleeping pills,"" he says.
The man's thumb is nearly ripped off, pointing in an odd direction.
The man explains how he recently had surgery and how he had taken the cast off prematurely because his hand hurt. He also tells firefighters that he missed a follow-up appointment with a doctor.
""We don't have any,"" firefighter Eric Shinn tells him. ""Go to the drugstore and get some NyQuil maybe. You can't be missing appointments.""
Shinn wraps the man's hand and finds a piece of cardboard to fashion a makeshift splint.
The man leaves.
Such grim scenes drive firefighters to find ways to escape and relax. They pull lots of pranks on one another -- like a seemingly serious ""training session"" ordered by Robles. It turned out to be a younger firefighter swinging nunchaku as his colleagues broke down in laughter.
There's lots of amusement in these moments -- a brief respite from what's happening outside.
Station No. 9's members are a tightknit crew. They vacation together. Their families grill together. Soriano recently led a crew of his fellow firefighters on a snowboarding trip to Austria. They also went to Chile and Japan.
""There's a brotherhood that you can't really speak about unless you have been there,"" Soriano said. ""We're involved in each other's lives. We hang out with our girlfriends and wives. We go on trips, and we have a lot of fun at the station.""
Another way firefighters let off steam is to play handball. It's the LAFD's official sport, and tournaments often attract old-timers who worked at the station decades ago. Sometimes they play in their socks to decide who will do dishes after dinner.
While a game was underway, Soriano and Robles sat in the kitchen and discussed how firefighters were adjusting to life at Station No. 9. Some were struggling with how much time they had to spend responding to medical calls.
It's common during the first year working on skid row for some firefighters to be sick all the time until their bodies adjust to the stress. Firefighters often spend their first year battling colds and feeling generally unwell.
""It's something like your freshman 15,"" Soriano said, comparing it to the belief that many college students gain weight in their first year.
He blamed it on the lack of sleep and unceasing exposure to the generally unhealthy environment of skid row.
""The hotels, the tents -- it's not necessarily the most clean place to operate,"" Soriano said. ""I got sick. It's not like you're throwing up. You're just sick constantly.""
--
11:38 p.m.: 118 E. 6th St., Cole's French Dip
Engine 209 pulls out of the station, and Mango steps into the street to block traffic. This happens a lot.
Firefighters arrive at Cole's French Dip and find a man flat on the ground. Patrons are standing around, wondering what's happening.
Villata digs into the man's pocket and finds a needle. His pupils are uneven.
They give him a dose of naloxone and his vitals return to normal.
""Let's go,"" Capt. Jim Duffy yells.
""Captain is tired,"" Gibson says to no one in particular.
--
4:47 a.m.: 1301 N. Main St.
Chatter over the radio alerts Station No. 9 to a fire in a neighboring district. Firefighters arrive to find an abandoned building, flames erupting from its mezzanine.
Robles grabs a saw to cut holes in the wall and ceiling. Soriano grabs a fan. They move room to room, putting out remnants of the conflagration.
Navarro pulls off his breathing mask.
There were 82 incidents in 24 hours.
Navarro had just worked 72 hours. Robles was scheduled to do another shift.
When the firefighters return to Station No. 9, the A shift has already arrived and is getting situated. Mango is outside grilling food that he intends to sell. Another day at the busiest fire station in Los Angeles has begun.

"COLUMN ONE; Still an uneasy mix: Korean liquor store, black community; A dispute 25 years after riots exposes tensions in South L.A.",Los Angeles Times,"Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitIt started with a stick, that much everybody can agree on.
A Korean stock boy wielded the stick at a black patron inside a Leimert Park liquor store late on a Sunday afternoon. In some tellings, the customer was rudely chased away for being short a nickel -- another instance of the Korean-owned store mistreating the surrounding African American community. In others, the man was drunk and making his third booze run of the day, and the employee denied him service, as required by law.
The incident in late 2017 pitted the store's longtime elderly Korean shopkeeper against a band of black activists who voiced familiar complaints about outsiders taking advantage of the scarcity of retail options in South L.A. It snowballed into a months-long boycott and protests and unnerved the neighborhood, the Korean community and a city that keenly remembers how similar tensions a quarter century ago culminated with Los Angeles up in flames.

In time, one party would be driven out of town and the other would claim victory, with city and community officials scrambling to draw up a plan to prevent such tensions in the future.
And to everyone involved, it was a reminder that the embers of the 1992 L.A. riots still smolder in communities where economic disparities and racial and cultural misunderstandings never went away.
A half-dozen members of the Africa Town Coalition were holding their weekly food bank in Leimert Park, passing out meals and produce, when someone ran over and told them about the skirmish at Hubert's Liquor.
They were regulars in the area, chanting black empowerment slogans and soliciting donations for food and school supply giveaways. Primarily middle-aged men, they belonged to the generation that came of age in Los Angeles during the collective ire of 1992, with the political angst but without the organizational prowess or scale of the Black Lives Matter movement.
For years, they had protested and boycotted businesses they believed had disrespected the community: a Walmart, a Boost Mobile, a Wienerschnitzel. When they heard about Hubert's, they kicked into action and announced a ""grand closing"" of the store. They made signs -- ""Our $$s count. Respect Black Power"" -- waved the black nationalist flag and brought out the bullhorn, blocking customers from entering the store.
The protests tapped into long-held complaints about Hubert's -- the prices a dollar or two higher than at big-box stores, the short treatment from employees who didn't seem to live in or care about the neighborhood, the row of photos taped on the bulletproof glass of suspected shoplifters. They didn't know much about the owner, a diminutive woman who spoke faltering English, but it almost didn't matter. To them, she was yet another outsider profiting off the neighborhood.
""They would add 5 cents more than necessary. For a lot of people, 5 cents is a big deal,"" said Eschelle Washington, 38.
Protests and boycotts were tried and true methods for the group. William ""Billion"" Campbell, 49, staged his first protest in his 20s when a convenience store clerk yelled at him and his cousin for reading comic books without buying them. The clerk apologized after two days.
""We have the right to hold them accountable and choke off their finances,"" said Kevin Wharton Price, one of the group's leaders. ""Irregardless of how people view our methods, our methodology is sound and successful.""
Hubert's is in the heart of Leimert Park, one of Los Angeles' last remaining historically black neighborhoods, an area the group was advocating to get renamed ""Africa Town."" Protesters cried out to customers that the store ""does not deserve the black and the brown dollars."" At one heated demonstration, Price and Campbell were briefly detained but not charged, and returned the next day to protest.
After weeks, when they felt their complaints were falling on deaf ears, they took the protest to Koreatown. The signs they carried didn't mince words:
""No More Korean Merchant Parasites.""
--
It almost felt like fate that Soon Yoon had ended up in Leimert Park.
She had arrived in the U.S. with little to her name. She first worked at a gas station, then sold tamales and menudo in Canoga Park before she saved up enough to buy a liquor store in East L.A. When her husband left her for a younger woman, the store became a lifeline for Yoon and her two children.
During the L.A. riots, dozens of Korean-owned liquor stores were burned to the ground. By then a single mother in her 50s, Yoon planned to move on to something safer, maybe a coin laundry, and sold her store.
But one day she missed her normal exit off the 10 Freeway and somehow ended up in Leimert Park. She saw a busy liquor store for sale and soon bought it with a Small Business Administration loan.
For two decades, Yoon said, she thought she had a good relationship with the community. Save for some kids who would run out with a can of this or that a couple times a year, she had little trouble.
Her prices weren't cheap, but an extra 2% or 3% markup was a business decision many shopkeepers made to take advantage of the lack of competition and compensate for what they believed was the risk of doing business in poorer, higher-crime areas.
""People think we're raking it in, but they don't see the 10 to 15 hours a day we put in, the loans we took out and the hard work we do,"" said Mike Kim, president of the Southern California Korean American Grocers Assn. ""They only think of the money we take away.""
Yoon had regulars with whom she exchanged warm greetings, who would come in for their morning paper or a snack after performances at a nearby theater let out. Now and then she paid a neighborhood guy down on his luck to sweep her parking lot. One man called her ""mama-san,"" and she would come out from behind the counter to give him a hug. Through the area merchants association, she donated to programs at nearby Crenshaw High.
The man who was chased out of the store with the stick also was a regular, the neighborhood drunk whose poison of choice is beer, Yoon said. She was watching through a security camera from the back when the trouble started.
When Yoon came out front to see what was going on, one of the women who took issue with the stock boy's behavior threw water at her. A handful of protesters returned the next day with their signs and bullhorns, and again the day after that.
What started with complaints about one man's mistreatment evolved into a litany of grievances, blaming all of the area's social ills on the store and the liquor it sells.
The protests continued for weeks, then months. Police officers repeatedly came by to keep the crowd from getting out of hand, but said they couldn't stop the group from rallying on public streets.
By December 2017, after months of on-and-off protests and lists of demands, Yoon's daughter, concerned for her 79-year-old mother, began imploring her to leave it all behind.
--
Alarmed by the protests, a store employee called the Korean American Federation, a community group that serves and represents first-generation, non-English-speaking immigrants.
Emile Mack, the federation's vice president and a retired Los Angeles Fire Department official, said he could see the dispute from both perspectives. An adoptee from South Korea raised by black parents in South L.A., he grew up going to a corner liquor store a lot like Hubert's for chips and soda in the '60s and '70s.
Using his connections, he assembled a group to talk out the situation -- representatives from the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, mayor's office, City Council and Assembly. The group began meeting at a church and later at City Hall, going over demands from the protesters.
Mack realized the situation at Hubert's was a sign that, however much leaders of the black and Korean communities were holding joint events and posing for photo ops, among many Angelenos, stereotypes and misunderstandings persisted.
""The people that are actually in the community don't have much better understanding or relationship than they did back in '92,"" he said. "" 'Koreans, they're just here taking our money. African Americans come in and they steal from us.' ... Basic things you could've heard 25 years ago, still being thought by most people in the community.""
Back then, nearly half the liquor stores in South L.A. were owned by Korean immigrants drawn by cheap rent, the minimal English required and a stock that doesn't go bad. They set up shop in neighborhoods they didn't understand at a time when crime was at an all-time high, police presence was heightened and black communities felt under siege.
Tensions rose in 1991 when a 15-year-old girl, Latasha Harlins, was shot in the back of her head by a Korean shopkeeper who suspected her of shoplifting. The hostility turned to rage when Soon Ja Du, convicted of manslaughter, was sentenced to probation. When South L.A. erupted in riots after the Rodney King verdict the following year, more than 2,300 Korean-owned businesses were looted and burned down.
In many ways, the Korean-owned liquor stores that still dot South L.A. today are a snapshot from the early 1990s. The majority of the owners are still first-generation immigrants whose children have gone on to more lucrative professions. Most of the customers also remain economically disenfranchised -- if not worse off -- compared with the rest of the city.
To Kirkpatrick Tyler, the mayor's field representative for South L.A., it seemed as if everyone involved in the Hubert's dispute simply wanted to be heard and acknowledged. He tried to act as a translator of sorts, ""listening to people and putting what they're saying in a palatable format that other people can understand.""
""It's an uncomfortable space,"" he said. ""It's about how do we make the decision, 'Let's stay in this space and talk to each other.' ""
After spending hours with the protesters and speaking extensively with Yoon, the owner, Mack drafted a response to the Africa Town Coalition's demands.
Yoon offered to participate in cultural sensitivity training and assist with local substance abuse programs; she agreed to offer more than just liquor and to make a monthly donation to the coalition's food program. Mack noted that Yoon already had been sponsoring nearby youth programs and that she had previously employed a black clerk for eight years until he retired, and had been trying to hire others since. Yoon had already removed the photos of alleged shoplifters.
In December 2017, as Mack and the protesters were going back and forth about what changes should be made at the store, Yoon quietly sold the business to another Korean owner. Mack said she felt she was being portrayed in an unfairly negative light.
""It was really troubling her obviously,"" he said. ""It was just getting to be too much.""
Yoon later said that she felt pressured to sell for far less than what Hubert's was worth. Some of her regulars, she added, implored her to stay, offering to call the police on the protesters on her behalf. She believes it was outsiders, not the community, who pushed her out.
""I never lost the neighborhood's heart,"" she said.
--
The protests continued for about a month after the ownership change, but eventually faded away. Since then, Hubert's has become a symbol of both progress and stagnation.
Simon Choi, the new owner, lowered prices, cleaned up the store's appearance and began stocking more fresh produce. He holds barbecues in the parking lot, donates beverages every week to Africa Town Coalition's food giveaway for homeless people and donates $100 monthly to support the group's activities. This fall, Choi also bought a new leaf blower for a neighborhood beautification project.
The Africa Town Coalition, the Korean American Federation and Mayor Eric Garcetti's office have explored using lessons from what happened at Hubert's elsewhere in Los Angeles. They talked of creating a ""cultural competency"" workshop for business owners to teach them communication skills and the historical context for specific communities, possibly devising a score that would be posted at each store like restaurant sanitation ratings.
But after several meetings, working groups and proposals, the effort has fizzled, with a new South L.A. representative for Garcetti's office and the community groups moving on to other issues.
Mack said recently that until fundamental inequalities are improved, another situation like Hubert's probably awaits in some other corner of Los Angeles.
""Unless there are changes that allow the smaller business to be acquired by the average person, it's still going to be difficult,"" he said. ""I don't think the changes have been made that make black ownership any more viable today than it was 25 years ago.""
This fall, there was one final piece of unfinished business from the battle over Hubert's.
Price, one of the protest leaders, walked into a downtown courthouse in November wearing a faded Africa Town sweatshirt. He had come to address the 2-year-old warrant he had received after demonstrating at the store. The penalty: a $400 fine.
To Price, it was worth it for Leimert Park. Besides, he said, he plans to let it go to collections anyway.

| Jump to first hitMIAMI -- The N.F.L.'s longtime leading men, the ones with the pizza commercials and the Super Bowl rings, whose names adorn the league's most-sold jerseys, showed their mortality this season in ways that were uncomfortable to watch.Tom Brady and Drew Brees didn't make it through the first round of the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers missed the Super Bowl, too, by losing in a later round. Eli Manning retired, usurped as the Giants' leader after 16 years. Ben Roethlisberger played like he should be considering it, too.Together they helmed 12 of the last 18 Super Bowl-winning teams. And all are pushing 40 years old or past it.Yet their aging out of the game leaves no void, as these playoffs have highlighted the rise of quarterbacks whose savvy and daring have stolen our attention. Russell Wilson's third-down scramble to survive the Philadelphia Eagles, Patrick Mahomes's bionic touchdown run for the Chiefs against the Tennessee Titans, Deshaun Watson of the Texans' magical escape from a sack to beat the Buffalo Bills. Everything that Lamar Jackson did.These quarterbacks are creating our new collective football memories. They are the ones from whom we dare not look away -- and they are each black, leading at a position that historically has been off-limits to any man who was not white.The smattering of black men who have risen to and excelled at the quarterback position were subject to stereotypes, slurs and targeting on the field when they did get the chance to play. And those opportunities seemed to be parceled by an unspoken ""one-at-a-time"" approach, which heaped the burden of progress on whichever black quarterback broke through in a given era. Doug Williams. Warren Moon. Randall Cunningham. Steve McNair. Donovan McNabb. Michael Vick. Colin Kaepernick.Jackson was expected to win the league's Most Valuable Player Award on Saturday -- only the third time a black quarterback would have done so outright. The win, following last year's winner, Patrick Mahomes, would make this the first time in the league's 100-year history that black quarterbacks had won in back-to-back years.""I mean, it shows you how the game has evolved and how no matter where you come from you can go out there and play the position you want to play and have success doing it and you don't have to do it in a certain way,"" Mahomes said in an interview on Thursday, just days before his Chiefs were to take on the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl.This time around, there is enough of a plurality to point to a pervasive change at the position, and not just among the game's elite. In 2019, there were 12 black quarterbacks who started N.F.L. games, one shy of the watermark reached in five seasons in the early 2000s. But this season's quarterbacks started a record 138 games, continuing an upward trend of black quarterbacks who sustain rather than spot-fill the role for franchises.Reversing a long history of being denied the chance to play, black quarterbacks are the most vital change agents of this era of football. But for as much as they may be celebrated, their arrival has stirred a lot of questions not easily answered. The most pressing: If this is a watershed moment in N.F.L. history, what can we expect on the other side of change?The league, and football in general, has a long history of stacking -- funneling players to positions based on racial stereotypes -- that kept black talent away from ""thinking"" positions like middle linebacker and center for decades. Essential to the game itself and to its lore, the quarterback position has been the last role unlocked for black players, who make up 70 percent of the N.F.L.'s labor force, for much the same reason that the other positions finally were: the game had to embrace elite players who are black or face stagnation.That welcoming has upended stereotypes about black quarterbacks being naturally superior athletes preferable only for their ball-carrying ability and not intellectually strategic game managers.""This idea that someone doesn't have the intellectual wherewithal to play the position because of their race has fallen by the wayside, and that's a positive thing,"" said Charles K. Ross, a professor of African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, and the author of ""Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League.""Each member of this current generational wave has proved himself a pocket passer, capable of dissecting coverage and wowing that way. But many also run, a lot. Not just clock-managing scampers and fight-or-flight rushes when their pockets collapse either. They sometimes even run right up the middle. The success of such run-pass offenses means that quarterbacks of this era are often running by design, even if the result of those runs seems serendipitous.The run-pass offense trend has sparked a need for and acceptance of this rise of stategically complex quarterbacks who can make that tactic work.""The teams are looking for the drop-pass passer, quick out of their hands,"" said James Harris, known as ""Shack,"" who was the first black quarterback to start in and win an N.F.L. playoff game. ""The rule changes to protect the quarterback more from hits, that philosophy has changed to allow more quarterbacks with mobility.""Harris, like his protégé, Doug Williams, the former Washington Redskins player who was the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, is one of the predecessors who emerged without the benefit of a rising tide, facing loaded questions whether he would be better suited for another position. . Like Williams and Harris before him, Jackson, too, faced pressure to switch positions before he went pro, which he hinted at in September when, after throwing five touchdowns, he quipped, ""not bad for a running back.""Whether this generation compels other franchises to copy this new quarterback design will be seen soon enough, in the N.F.L. draft in April.The trajectories of two elder statesmen, Russell Wilson and Cameron Newton, who led their teams to Super Bowls with thrilling displays of accuracy and contact-busting runs, force us, however, to reckon with the limits of this sea change.After the 2014 season, Wilson became only the second black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, 27 years after Williams's landmark win. Wilson, at 31, is now the undisputed leader of the Seattle Seahawks whose authority there derived at least in part from his game-defining runs when there were no passing options left.But Newton, 30, the first black quarterback to outright win the league's Most Valuable Player Award -- when he led the league in touchdown percentage and game-winning drives in the 2015 season -- faces a rebuild in Carolina, an uncertain rehab for his injured left foot, and a contract that expires this year. After nine seasons, some pundits have questioned whether Newton's team wouldn't be in better hands with its second-year undrafted quarterback, Kyle Allen.Still, the true indication of whether this is an era-defining shift won't just be determined by their fates or whether the new generation gives immediate rise to copycats.It will hinge on if this cohort retains the halo-effect of having been elite quarterbacks, the most iconic position in all of American sports, if they will forge a different path than the one Williams faced in Washington. Two years after his Super Bowl win, he was replaced by a middling backup and, with no offers from another team, retired after the 1989 season.It will presumably take many years to learn if there will be golden opportunities on and off the field like a broadcast booth spot instantly yielded to Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys the moment he retires, as happened to his brethren Don Meredith, Troy Aikman and Tony Romo. In less time, we'll see if, at a career crossroads, Newton will be compared to, say, Alex Smith, who received second and thirds shots at being a franchise-leader after being pushed out in San Francisco.In a copycat league, where assistants are interviewed for head coaching slots based on mere proximity to trendsetters, we are learning that coaching a phenomenally successful black quarterback is not a guarantee of the career boost that white coordinators have traditionally received.For as much as Mahomes has come to define the quarterback position and stands at the vanguard of the new era, his offensive coordinator, Eric Bieniemy, who is black, was passed over for a head coaching position after being interviewed by three different teams during this playoff run. Despite guiding the league's M.V.P. and being the latest plum from the Andy Reid coaching tree, Bieniemy, with his record of résumé-builders, did not get a head coaching opportunity as similarly and less-qualified white men regularly do.If this generation's brilliance is more than just a moment of exceptionalism the ripple effect should extend to the rank and file this off-season. Indianapolis Colts leadership is shopping the contract of Jacoby Brissett, who replaced franchise star Andrew Luck after his shocking retirement. Teddy Bridgewater, who won five consecutive games in New Orleans as Drew Brees's fill-in and previously was a Pro Bowl selection as a Minnesota Viking, is unsigned.By definition it is only a watershed moment if the effect is widespread and persistent. Systemic, one might say. That generational progress, tenuous and subject to retrenching, is best viewed from distance.Ken Belson and Benjamin Hoffman contributed reporting.Photographs by Associated Press, Elise Amendola/Associated Press, Bill Johnson/The Denver Post, via Getty Images.Ken Belson and Benjamin Hoffman contributed reporting.PhotographPatrick Mahomes after the Chiefs won the A.F.C. championship on Jan. 19.

| Jump to first hitWith brassy quips and state-centric memes, @NJGov is trying to burnish New Jersey's much-maligned reputation.The two women who run New Jersey's official state Twitter account, Megan Coyne and Pearl Gabel, know all about the reputation their home state has developed over decades.They are all too aware that New Jersey has often been derided as ""the armpit of America"" and ridiculed for the odor that the moniker implies. Though they both identify as ""Jersey girls,"" they know that phrase calls up a stereotype that many residents deeply resent.They realize that when outsiders reference ""dirty Jersey,"" it's not generally a term of endearment. The first glimpse of the state for many visitors is a trip from Newark Liberty International Airport along aging highways that pass a vast and unattractive industrial waterfront.The women know it all. And on @NJGov, the Twitter account they run, they own and embrace it.""Armpit what,"" read one tweet from last month, with a stunning video from the Jersey Shore. ""Hi haters,"" said another. A third simply said ""dirty jerz"" and pulled in more than 4,000 likes.""New Jersey's been kind of the butt of national jokes for so long,"" said Ms. Coyne, a digital assistant in the governor's office. ""It has not the best reputation among people, and we really wanted to change that.""Ms. Gabel, her boss, put it another way.""Jersey fresh. Jersey strong. Jersey girl. Jersey whatever,"" she said, essentially rattling off a list of Garden State hashtags. ""We're Jersey.""Over the past two years, Ms. Coyne and Ms. Gabel have channeled their innate, deeply felt love for New Jersey into a bold, sassy social media account that has generated considerable attention on Twitter, where celebrities, thirsty brands and influencers compete for clicks.Perhaps more impressively, the two have managed to distill a playfully combative New Jersey swagger into state-centric memes and quips that feel authentic both to the internet and to the Garden State itself.""New Jersey is all about attitude, edginess, pride, diversity,"" Gov. Philip D. Murphy said in an interview. ""We speak our mind. We don't hold back, we don't shy away.""The Twitter account run by Ms. Gabel and Ms. Coyne has managed to synthesize all of that while at the same time spreading information about state policies and informing the public of crucial news, he said.""Pearl and Megan are nothing if not completely and utterly authentic,"" said the governor, a Democrat whose own Twitter account is far more sedate than his state's. ""I know them well enough to know that, but I think it screams out in the posts that we put up.""Among those posts are needling jabs at neighboring states, an emoji-filled outline of New Jersey that launched a bagel war and New Jersey-specific twists on beloved memes, including a picture of the much-adored Baby Yoda holding the Garden State that has become @NJGov's profile picture.Other government accounts have also recently tried to take a more humorous approach. New York City's Conflict of Interest Board has drawn on slang and memes, making the often dry conversation around government ethics more accessible. The city's Police Department's precincts have also tried a lighter tone and emojis to soften their public safety announcements.Still, among states, New Jersey seems unusual for how successfully it has infused its online presence with such brashness.Take Delaware's account, @delaware_gov, with which New Jersey is in an ongoing Twitter feud. That state has taken a more staid approach to its social media and has about a third as many followers as @NJGov despite being about a decade older.Perhaps no one message encapsulates New Jersey's Twitter attitude better than ""your mom""-- a two-word tweet sent last December that vaulted @NJGov into the spotlight.At the time, Ms. Gabel and Ms. Coyne had been running the Twitter account for months, mixing standard public-service announcements with their brand of Jersey humor. They had generated a modest following, to the extent that a curious internet user saw their tweets and questioned @NJGov's reason for being. ""Who let New Jersey have a Twitter,"" he wrote.Both women took umbrage.""I was like 'That's so rude,"" said Ms. Coyne. ""And Pearl was like 'I kind of want to respond 'your mom.""'Ms. Coyne began laughing hysterically. Ms. Gabel, who sits in the cubicle next to her, took that as a good sign. After about 30 seconds of consideration, the pair sent the playground taunt to the online ether.""We didn't think about it,"" Ms. Coyne said. ""I don't think we imagined it being the banger that it was.""The tweet went on to pick up more than 80,000 retweets and generated a handful of news articles. In the day that followed, @NJGov nearly tripled its followers from 17,000 to more than 60,000, according to data provided by a Twitter spokesman.""'Your mom' is the gold standard,"" Ms. Gabel said without a hint of irony. ""'Your mom' is the standard that we measure everything against.""Ms. Gabel, 38, joined Mr. Murphy's administration as its digital director when the governor took office. It was a return to her beloved home state after years in New York City, where she worked as a journalist before joining Mayor Bill de Blasio's office as its director of video.At the time, New Jersey's online presence was ""a digital wasteland,"" she said. So for months, she overhauled the state's website, launched social media accounts for Mr. Murphy and worked with state agencies.Ms. Coyne, 22, joined her full-time after she graduated from Rutgers University last June. That's when the two began discussing how to make @NJGov, originally conceived as a way to stir up state pride and distribute important government information, more authentic and relatable.The Twitter voice of New Jersey comes from a fusion of both women's sensibilities.Ms. Coyne, who identifies as a digital native and first joined Twitter when she was 13, is the one with deeper meme knowledge who keeps abreast of current online trends. Ms. Gabel, who described herself as an older millennial, supplements her employee's online savvy with one-liners and cheeky clapbacks.Both women also have the state firmly at their cores Ms. Gabel was raised in Monmouth County, and even during her years in New York City, she never cast off her New Jersey pride, she said.Ms. Coyne grew up in Livingston, a bedroom community about 20 miles west of Manhattan, and has lived in New Jersey her whole life.""We're both Jersey Girls, but we do have different personalities, different interests, different strong suits,"" Ms. Coyne observed. ""And the way they mesh -- it's perfect.""Recurring themes on @NJGov include the joys of not pumping one's own gas (self-service stations are banned in the state), the heated battle over whether a certain processed meat product should be called pork roll or Taylor ham and a frequent insistence that Central Jersey is a region independent from the state's north and south.""People outside might be like, what are they talking about and why do you care?"" Ms. Gabel said. ""But for some reason -- like, this is how we grew up. And it's part of our DNA and we just get it.""For Mr. Murphy, it is the two women's innate understanding of a certain kind of Jersey attitude that makes their approach so successful. While he expects other states might catch on, he was skeptical that they would be as successful.""Do you have the attitude, the character, the humor, the edginess, the pride that all wrap together to define New Jersey?"" Mr. Murphy asked. ""To me, that may be the biggest X-factor in this.""Ms. Gabel, for her part, would love to see more states embrace their stereotypes, warts and all, as a way to spread regional pride and engage people in the political process.""Imagine if, like, Minnesota came out tweeting in a Minnesota accent,"" she said. ""That would be off the hook. It would be awesome. ""Even so, Ms. Gabel doesn't think @NJGov's particular brand of humor can be exactly replicated.""We're a little state with big state energy,"" she said.PhotographTop, Megan Coyne, left, and Pearl Gabel have injected sassiness into New Jersey's official Twitter account.

| Jump to first hitDevelopers are offering a physical twist to keep traditional fans interested and draw new ones who are bored with their workouts.Tiffany Ruiz had tried various gyms, apps, workout routines and diets, all in an effort to get fit and lose some weight. ""None of them worked because none of them kept my interest,"" she said.Now, Ms. Ruiz is working out at least four times a week, thanks to a video game.In her bedroom, she sprints, squats, stretches and performs other exercises like knee lifts and shoulder presses, all while battling a musclebound dragon and its toadies in Ring Fit Adventure, a new game from Nintendo, the Japanese consumer tech giant.""I am so focused on beating the high score or conquering an enemy that before I know it, 30 minutes have passed,"" said Ms. Ruiz, 26, who is studying to become a nursing assistant in Bakersfield, Calif.Ring Fit Adventure, created for the Nintendo Switch console, is the latest effort by the video game industry to try to entice consumers to get up off the couch and become more active. Developers are folding fitness into games as part of a dual-pronged strategy: to retain players by offering a physical twist on traditional gameplay and to draw in new ones like Ms. Ruiz who are looking to break up the monotony of working out.The campaign appeals to parents and other caregivers worried about the amount of time children spend glued to screens. And the games help counter the stereotype of the sedentary player, sitting in a chair for hours on end.""Developers are trying to reach people who want fun and fitness at the same time,"" said Rik Eberhardt, a program manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Game Lab. ""They know fitness is good for them, but it can feel like a chore in their busy lives.""Fitness games make up just 1 percent of the market, but the overall industry is steadily growing. Sales of games across all platforms generated $35.4 billion in the United States last year, up 2 percent from 2018, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.""Our latest data shows 73 percent of U.S. consumers play video games of one sort or another,"" said Mat Piscatella, an industry analyst for NPD. ""Given the wide range of the players, the industry does have great opportunity to provide more gaming experience variety.""""Exergaming,"" a portmanteau of exercise and gaming, has been around since the late 1980s, when Bandai introduced Power Pad, a gray mat with pressure sensors, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Games now use motion sensors, smartwatches and even virtual reality to track a player's movement.The gameplay has changed, too. Some games disguise fitness routines in the form of role-playing, dancing or other activities like running from zombies. Others are fitness and health apps that lead users through workouts with gamelike features such as scoreboards, real-time feedback and multiplayer options.Nintendo's Wii game console brought exergaming into the mainstream in 2006. Its Wii Fit game incorporated a balance board so players burned calories through calisthenics and yoga.""The Wii had the fastest adoption rate in the U.S. of any console in the first three years,"" Mr. Piscatella said. Wii Fit remains one of the best-selling games in the United States, according to NPD.Nintendo's two main competitors, Microsoft and Sony, followed its lead, adding motion-detecting cameras to their consoles. Games like Just Dance and Zumba Fitness: Join the Party, which were available on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony consoles, were ""breakout successes"" in the motion era, Mr. Piscatella said.Since then, the industry has been overturned by the rise of mobile devices, which allow games to be played on the go.""Consumer expectations have changed dramatically,"" Mr. Piscatella said. ""People are no longer just playing on their TVs in their living room. They now want to be able to play games whenever and wherever.""Zombies, Run! coaches runners to complete hundreds of missions, including one with the author Margaret Atwood, in order to escape the zombie apocalypse while running a 5K. In Pokemon Go, players capture creatures in real-world locations using augmented reality and GPS on their phones.Hoping to build on that trend, Nintendo in 2017 introduced the Switch, which functions both as a traditional console and a hand-held device. The Switch was the fastest-selling console in the United States that year and has sold more than 52 million units.""Part of the Switch is an acknowledgment that Nintendo's main competition is no longer just Microsoft and Sony but Apple and Google, too,"" said Philip Tan, creative director of the M.I.T. Game Lab.He added that Nintendo was drawing on its strength in creating games that bridge the digital and physical world. ""Instead of trying to compete with other console makers with better cinematography, they have created an innovative new console,"" Mr. Tan said.The company has focused on games, like Ring Fit Adventure, that use consoles in new ways, said Bill Trinen, a senior director of product marketing at Nintendo.""Nintendo wants to create games that encourage people to get active and motivate them to stay active,"" Mr. Trinen said. He added that the company hoped the role-playing adventure format would encourage people to play longer.Part of Ring Fit's popularity stems from its unique controller, a flexible resistance hoop that Nintendo calls a Ring Con. When players squeeze it, pull it or hold it above their head, their movements are tracked in the game.Other games incorporate new hardware, too. Beat Saber, a music game from Beat Games, relies on virtual reality goggles; it sold more than one million copies in nine months after being introduced in 2018.But Ring Fit is attracting a growing number of fans to the gameplay. ""I love it because it is this fun, goofy story that is way more intense than Wii Fit. It hides the workout, and you can't cheat,"" said Tristan Scatliffe, a 33-year-old product manager who lives in Brooklyn. ""The first time I played it, I was dripping with sweat.""The late-night talk show host Jimmy Fallon posted, on Twitter, a video of himself playing one of the Ring Fit mini-games, Spinal Erectors Challenge.Many exergames promote movement, but whether they increase physical fitness is up for debate. Critics have said they found the exercise routines underwhelming, and a study at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found that Wii games did not help children meet daily exercise requirements.Some researchers are creating their own exergames. Eefje Battel, a project manager at the Sports Innovation Campus at the Howest University of Applied Sciences in Bruges, Belgium, uses Makey Makey in several of the center's exergame projects for children. Developed by JoyLabz, Makey Makey is an ""invention kit"" that allows users to connect everyday objects to the internet via alligator clips and a simple keyboard.Ms. Battel created a version of Tetris, the '80s puzzle game in which falling blocks are manipulated to fit them in a straight line. In her version, conductors are attached to bananas and other fruit, and children have to run from fruit to fruit to move the tiles in the game.Regardless of the fun factor, exergames are not without risks, Ms. Battel said. One element that is missing in Ring Fit, she said, is a coach to ensure that players are performing exercises correctly and safely.""If you are squatting, the system will measure movement up and down, but it won't track posture,"" she said.Nintendo is hoping Ring Fit becomes a top-selling game as Wii Fit did in its heyday. Game analysts like Mr. Piscatella have not yet decided.""What makes Nintendo unique is their willingness to push boundaries, and when Nintendo is really weird, they are at their best,"" he said. ""Ring Fit Adventure could be the biggest thing or not. It's still hard to predict.""PhotographTiffany Ruiz exercises with the Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure, a game on the Nintendo Switch, in Bakersfield, Calif.

| Jump to first hitThe state with a huge influence in picking presidential candidates doesn't look much like the country as a whole. Except in the 60-plus crowd.DUBUQUE, Iowa -- Like most campaign events held in daylight hours during the week, Pete Buttigieg's town hall in Dubuque recently was a sea of gray hair. When the time came for questions, many were from older people sharing personal stories of declining health, concerns about the cost of prescription drugs and questions about access to experimental treatment.A man who said he and his wife ""just entered the realm of septuagenarians,"" brought up the topic of assisted suicide, asking Mr. Buttigieg about legislation to help seniors with severe dementia have an ""assisted transition.""With an impeachment reprieve over the weekend, all of the top Democratic presidential candidates were back in Iowa this weekend, seeking support in Monday's caucuses from an electorate that is more white and more rural than most of the United States.Iowa's outsized role in presidential politics is often criticized for precisely that reason. But Iowa mirrors the nation's economy and demography in one very striking way -- the state's rapidly aging population and the myriad economic, political and social consequences that flow from it.Similarly, the economy that will have to support that population also mirrors the rest of the country. Its unemployment rate is low but economic growth is modest. Metropolitan areas are prospering. Rural ones dependent on agriculture are not.""Iowa's economy is two economies -- we have a thriving metropolitan economy and then a nonmetropolitan economy that has not in aggregate recovered from the Great Recession -- it's losing jobs, it's losing people, and we can see the consequences of this distress playing out."" said David Swenson, an associate scientist in Iowa State's economics department.The state known for corn and soybeans, its gas station pizza and life-size butter cow conjures stereotypes, said Mary Swander, one of Iowa's former poet laureates. She has written about how outsiders view residents: ""We're rednecks and hayseeds from the hinterlands, the backcountry, the backwoods, and the boondocks.""In reality, said Ms. Swander, who lives in rural Johnson County, ""We've got all the problems that are a microcosm of the rest of the United States.""And like the nation, it is increasingly driven by the impacts of its aging population.Twenty years ago, Iowa had one of the oldest populations in the nation, and its senior population has grown rapidly since then.But the nation's older population has grown even faster, and today Iowa is squarely in the middle of the pack when states are ranked by age.In Iowa's smaller cities and rural counties, the increase in older residents does not make up for the loss of younger ones. In many parts of the state, the population is falling.The share of United States residents over 60 is at a historic high, according to census data.Iowa is now one of 27 where the population under 60 is declining while the population over 60 is growing.Like elsewhere in the nation, Iowa's aging population poses an economic headwind. The wave of retirees saps savings, shifting spending to health services and shrinking the labor force.The young people who remain in the state are increasingly concentrated in a handful of cities. In the Des Moines metropolitan area, the population is growing at all age levels.Elsewhere, communities have been retrofitted to adapt to its senior population, with modifications to parks, new walking paths and bus services to ensure accessibility. The Iowa Democratic Party's 99 new satellite caucuses, created to make the process more accessible, includes more than two dozen assisted-living facilities or sites frequented by seniors.""It's a hugely important constituency,"" said Bill Schickel, mayor of Mason City, which still broadcasts its City Council meetings on a public access channel to serve its large senior population accustomed to watching meetings on television rather than streaming on the internet. ""They have high voting numbers and are regular voters.""Seniors' concerns have dominated numerous campaign events in the state, so much so that younger voters have struggled for attention to their issues.""O.K., so hi, I'm a student here,"" said a young woman at Mr. Buttigieg's town hall, which was at Dubuque University. ""And I've been to a couple town halls: Booker, Warren, Biden. And at every single one I was probably one of three or four college students."" With so few of her peers in the crowd, she wanted to know: ""How important is this generation in this election?""Broadly, the economic discussion on the 2020 trail has incorporated issues of general concern to younger voters: student debt and free college; a general progressive pitch for wealth tax.In Iowa earlier this month, though, one of the most intense battles between the leading candidates centered on a matter of great importance to older Iowans: Social Security.Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 77, clashed repeatedly over the issue, as Mr. Sanders's camp questioned Mr. Biden's record on Social Security, seeking to cut into Mr. Biden's appeal with older voters, while Mr. Biden insisted that he wanted to strengthen the program and expand benefits.One effect of Iowa's aging is that its overall population is growing more slowly than the rest of the country, and according to a recent Iowa State University study, this has become a cyclical problem as new residents are deterred from moving to a state where growth is sluggish.The problems of an aging population have been compounded in Iowa by the struggles of the agricultural economy.Farming states such as Iowa have struggled to keep pace with the rest of the country in terms of job creation and wages. According to Mr. Swenson, Iowa has been a laggard in that regard, with the rate of job creation since the last recession ranking sixth worst in the United States.Economic forces that were already shaping Iowa's economy have been exacerbated by policies enacted by Mr. Trump, putting additional pressure on farmers and manufacturers at a time when many are considering retiring.Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist in Iowa and co-founder of the advocacy group Focus on Rural America, pointed to declining pork and soybean prices over the last year as a result of the president's trade war with China. The trade tension has also taken a toll on manufacturers that service farmers.Mr. Link said that the administration's waivers for oil companies have also been problematic for the ethanol industry and put pressure on corn prices.""He made a promise to support corn growers and ethanol and he chose oil,"" Mr. Link said of Mr. Trump. ""He has taken on more water on that issue than he did on trade.""John Heisdorffer, a soybean producer from Keota, Iowa, who is chairman of the American Soybean Association, said that farmers have been frustrated with Mr. Trump and feel disappointed that they have not seen an immediate pickup in soybean sales since the trade deal with China was signed in mid-January.""Everyone is going to look at which candidate can change this down beat we've had for the last two years,"" Mr. Heisdorffer said.Rural hospitals have been closing and reducing services. While new, high wage jobs are scarce in Iowa, the state struggles to fill the jobs it does offer. It has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, leaving its smaller communities unable to fill jobs in slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants.In many communities, immigrants have moved in to help fill jobs in an aging work force struggling to find enough workers.While Iowa remains one of the least diverse states in the nation -- 85 percent of the population is white and non-Hispanic -- diversity is growing. Like half of the states in the U.S., Iowa's white population is shrinking, while its minority population is growing.In Cedar Rapids, Iowa's demographics are on full display at St. Paul's Methodist Church, which offers services in English, Swahili and Kirundi. A few Sundays each year, immigrant congregants from Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo mingle with white senior citizens for worship services and potlucks.Rev. Daniel Niyonzima, a Burundian who lived in a refugee camp in Tanzania before fleeing to the United States, listed Iowa's appeal for immigrants: good schools and cheap housing -- with rents that are half the price of apartments in Rhode Island, where he first settled -- and access to jobs suitable for people struggling to learn English.""All this made me love Iowa,"" said Rev. Niyonzima, who has lived in the state for 12 years, ""and want to stay in Iowa.""Katie Glueck and Reid Epstein contributed reporting.PhotographOutside an event for Senator Elizabeth Warren in Mason City, Iowa. The state is one of 27 with a growing population over age 60.

| Jump to first hitMost are paying attention, get what it's all about and have strong opinions about impeachment -- but not always the opinions you'd expect.""A fit of partisan rage"" is how Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, characterized the bid to remove President Trump from office. The president's behavior, in the view of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left House Democrats with ""no choice"" but to impeach.But what do the American people think?With the Senate trial of Mr. Trump now underway, we deployed a team of journalists to find out. We contacted hundreds of voters who had responded to an online survey saying they would be willing to be interviewed. We reached 81 people, from nearly 30 states.They were Democrats, Republicans and independents. They were retirees and real estate agents, teachers and stay-at-home parents. The youngest was 21; the oldest was 82. Even before the opening statements at the trial had begun, most had already made up their minds on their preferred verdict.As one independent voter from Ohio put it, ""maybe they should ask the people what they should do. It should be our vote.""Though the case against Mr. Trump is complex, most people grasp the basics.The last time a president was impeached, in the 1990s, the allegations were like something out of a soap opera: President Bill Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual encounters with a White House intern.This time around, the charges stem from something much more complicated and less familiar than a sex scandal: using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against a domestic rival.We wondered how closely Americans were following the complicated case. ""I think it's about them interfering with the election or something? I'm not sure. It's very confusing,"" said one Republican who didn't think the evidence was very strong. One Democrat who thought Mr. Trump should be removed acknowledged, ""I don't really know what the evidence is.""But most people, across the political spectrum, were well versed in the basics, and some could even reel off names of key witnesses and documents.Here are some of their descriptions of the case, in their own words.The accusation is that he withheld foreign aid money in exchange for Ukrainians investigating Joe Biden and his son. Kyle Sims, 46, a Republican from North CarolinaThere are two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Bill Oberjohn, 82, a Democrat from OhioSupposedly he was colluding, or he was proposing to the leaders of -- I can't think of the name of the country. Not Czechoslovakia. Joe Biden and his son had gotten involved a few years ago in the Ukraine. It's the Ukraine, right? Tim Tucker, 73, a conservative independent who splits his time between Indiana and FloridaGoing to Ukraine and asking their government for interference for our election and digging up dirt on a political opponent. Bottom line, he was asking for the quid pro quo. Melissa Reese, 32, a Democrat from Allentown, Pa.I'm confused on what they're accusing him of, but it just has to do with the communication with the Ukrainian president. They haven't been able to glom onto anything yet and this was as close as they could get after all the pressure that they've gotten. Amy, 47, a Republican from IllinoisOne side sees impeachment as a ploy in a wider partisan war against Mr. Trump.People we spoke with who said they did not want Mr. Trump to be removed from office tended to view impeachment as an intensely personal attack on the president, mounted by Democrats who despise Mr. Trump and resent his election victory in 2016.I'm convinced of my view because of the blatant disrespect that President Trump has been shown by those who oppose him. It seems as though they would have him impeached at any cost, with no regard to truth or proper proceedings. Bethany McGraw, 21, a Republican from FloridaThey just don't like the man because he's not a politician. They can't reconcile their 2016 defeat of a career politician by a businessman. They can't stand it that he's outthinking them and outmaneuvering them on every issue. Gerald Wilson, 50, a conservative Democrat from OklahomaI think the whole thing is ridiculous. You can tell that the Democrats are just out to get Trump. It's just obvious. I feel like there's no grounds to impeach him. It's just insane. Cherece Mendieta, 46, a conservative from HoustonAs a former law enforcement officer, there is no case there. Absolutely no case. The president did not do anything wrong. It's a shame that so many people hate the president to the point where they will try to make the case where there is none. Bill Marcy, 73, a Republican from MississippiThe other side sees the Ukraine allegations as just the tip of the iceberg.For Democrats and others who said they want the president removed, asking about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine was like opening a Pandora's box of other presidential decisions they disagreed with -- and, in some cases, thought could be impeachable offenses in their own right.I'm upset with the Democrats. They should have listed about 50 things. They should have just buried him. I think that he's guilty of crimes against humanity with regard to immigrants. Now that it's come out that he planned six weeks ago to commit an assassination on a foreign national, to me that's an international crime. Terry Scott, 55, a liberal from Kent, Wash.This is bigger than this particular case -- his mental ramblings, his strong support of strongmen in other countries, his completely flouting the democracy that we have. He's polarizing the nation, putting children in cages. There are so many reasons, but right now, I support that they are impeaching him for obstructing Congress and trying to do their job. Gina Fields, 54, a Democrat from Los AngelesWe have a very big character issue with him. He's made fun of people, he's attacked people's ethnicity, he's attacked people's capabilities, especially making fun of people who might have severe learning issues. He name-calls. Yes, the economy is doing well and he's going to take all of the credit, and I don't know if that is right or wrong. But I think we are at the worst possible time, in terms of the divisiveness of the country, that we have been in my lifetime. Jimmy Welch, 53, a Republican from Louisville, Ky., who voted for President Trump in 2016 but is considering voting against him in 2020I think those are the ones that the House thought would stick, but I do think he's been doing a pretty bad job locally and internationally. His use of hate speech in order to rally supporters. Him closing the borders. America was a country that was built on immigration in the beginning. Desiré Hardison, 37, a Democrat from New York CityI believe even before this case came up to the attention of the American people, Trump's rhetoric on immigration, linking south border refugees to criminals, is an invitation to incite riots and frontiersman's approach to justice. That was enough to be considered a high crime in my mind. Yin Yeh, 81, a liberal Democrat from CaliforniaNot everything is partisan. Sometimes it's complicated.Over all, our interviews captured views of impeachment that largely break along partisan lines. But at the same time, they also offered a refreshing reminder that people are complicated, and often defy political and demographic stereotypes.Would you have guessed that the 21-year-old we mentioned was a Republican, and the 82-year-old a Democrat?When we asked people where they got their news, many cited outlets that aligned with their political bents. But others listed an array of sometimes contradictory sources, like the moderate who said his media diet included both MSNBC, with its liberal-leaning prime-time opinion shows, and a podcast by the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. One California man in his 70s told us he gets almost all his information from YouTube.And we found that negative feelings about Mr. Trump did not always translate into a desire to see him impeached.The Senate should probably not remove him from office at this point. Probably his misdeeds do not amount to high crimes and misdemeanors, and the uproar from his supporters would dislocate life in the U.S. for years. Terry Morrison, 82, a Democrat from WisconsinAs far as news goes, I've got CNN right next to Fox News on my Sirius satellite. William Johnson, 50, a conservative from TexasHas he done inappropriate things? Yeah, I hate to tell you, every president has. I don't like the man personally. I can understand why they don't like him. But that's not grounds for impeachment. Richard Thomas, 73, a Republican from Avondale, Ariz.I don't think he should've been elected in the first place, but I think it's bad for an impeachment to be this close to an election. He should not be removed. William Hogan, 35, a moderate from AtlantaAnd finally, a few choice outtakes.You've got me fired up here on a Wednesday afternoon. I have to go visit a 100-year-old lady that's in the nursing home. Mr. Tucker, a retiree whom we caught between golf rounds in FloridaI can say, damn near everything I've ever been accused of, I did it. Jonathan Swenson, 38, from Utah, who says he originally registered Republican but isn't so sure nowFiona Hill -- that would be a great name for an alternative band. Jerry Iannacci, 52, an independent from Pennsylvania, praising an impeachment witnessIf you can think of some way to bring America back together, I would pat you on the back and give you an award. Mary Moerles, 73, a conservative independent from MissouriMethodology: We obtained a list of more than 1,000 people who had responded to an online survey and said they were voters and were willing to be interviewed by a reporter. We reached out to several hundred of those voters -- covering a wide range of ages, races and ethnicities, political leanings and home states -- and conducted interviews with 81 of them; their views are presented here. Quotations were edited for brevity and clarity. The interviews do not constitute a scientific sampling of opinion.PhotographThe impeachment proceedings against the president, from the early investigation to the trial that started this week, have animated people in Battle Creek, Mich., at far left, Doylestown, Pa., at right, and many other places besides. Most are paying attention, get what it's all about, and have strong opinions about what's happening -- but not always the ones you'd expect.

| Jump to first hitAlabama Montgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr. , Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E. D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.  Alaska Juneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.  Arizona Heber-Overgaard: U. S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time. ” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.  Arkansas Little Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8. 8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1. 6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1. 5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.  California Sacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U. S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.  Colorado Denver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U. S. Senate candidate.  Connecticut Hartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive. ” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.  Delaware Hockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.  District of Columbia Washington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D. C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D. C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D. C. , these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally. ” Florida Tallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.  Georgia Atlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U. S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.  Hawaii Honolulu: The U. S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.  Idaho Boise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12. 1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.  Illinois Chicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.  Indiana Bloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T. E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.  Iowa Waterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets. ” Kansas Topeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You. ” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.  Kentucky Frankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.  Louisiana New Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.  Maine Westbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride. ” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.  Maryland Baltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U. S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse. ” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse. ” Massachusetts Boston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.  Michigan Owosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them. ” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.  Minnesota Minneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.  Mississippi Jackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U. S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.  Missouri St. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination. ” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve. ” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.  Montana Choteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.  Nebraska Lincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.  Nevada Reno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline. ” New Hampshire Concord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U. S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a. m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.  New Jersey Trenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare. ” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.  New Mexico Jemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.  New York New York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York. ” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.  North Carolina Wilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.  North Dakota Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.  Ohio Cincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2. 5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.  Oregon Salem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts. ” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.  Rhode Island Providence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p. m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U. S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.  South Carolina Greenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.  South Dakota Pierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U. S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U. S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.  Tennessee Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.  Texas Corpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.  Utah Salt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.  Vermont Burlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.  Virginia Richmond: State officials and U. S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection. ” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.  Washington Newhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable. ” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.  West Virginia Ripley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.  Wisconsin Milwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.  Wyoming Jackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.

| Jump to first hitNEWPORT, R. I. – The Office of Naval Inspector General has cleared former Naval War College president Rear Adm. Jeffrey A. Harley of most of the allegations of misconduct claimed to have occurred after he took command of the 136-year-old school in July 2016, The Providence Journal has learned.  Harley, in one of a series of interviews with the The Providence Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, called the findings “deeply gratifying. ” He said many of the most sensational allegations – “offers of ‘free hugs’ and games of Twister in his office” – reflected a misunderstanding of his sense of humor, which he describes as “quirky,” but which he says was intended to ease tensions in what can be a stressful environment.  The allegations, reported last year by the Associated Press, prompted a national controversy that led to Harley leaving the college presidency after almost three years in office.  Two allegations have been referred without judgment to other branches of the Navy. Harley has contested the remaining ones.  The findings are contained in a 148-page “Tentative Report of Investigation,” issued on Dec. 23. A copy of the report, which is labeled “unclassified,” was independently obtained by The Providence Journal.  The investigation was administrative in nature, not criminal, and no type of sanction is recommended in the Tentative Report, which has been forwarded to the Department of Defense and the Chief of Naval Operations for their review and recommendations, if any. That process could take weeks or months, as could the Inspector General’s finalization of its report.  Previously: Navy appoints first female president of the US Naval War College Allegations from excessive spending to margarita machines The allegations first publicly surfaced in a June 7 Associated Press story that cited information from “multiple current and former college employees,” none of them named in the article, who claimed Harley “spent excessively, abused his hiring authority and otherwise behaved inappropriately, including keeping a margarita-making machine in his office. ” Controversy embroiled Harley and days after the story was published, he left the college presidency.  Adm. John M. Richardson, then the service’s Chief of Naval Operations, said he removed Harley, telling the AP in another story that although an investigation was not concluded “there was just enough actionable information at that point that I made the decision that I did. ” Attempts this week and last to reach Richardson, now a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, were unsuccessful.  Harley disputes Richardson’s description, telling The Providence Journal he “stepped down because of the distraction caused by a scurrilous AP article. ” After more than 37 years of service, Harley, 59, retired from the Navy honorably and with full benefits in December. He criticized the investigation process, saying it placed him in a position of “guilty until proven innocent. ” The controversy has roots early in Harley’s presidency, when the two-star admiral began changes he said were designed to transform the venerable institution into a modern university that would more closely resemble a top private or state school, such as Brown or the University of Rhode Island.  Among the changes was raising salaries for women faculty, who were receiving less pay than men for identical work, an inequity that Harley told The Providence Journal was “immoral, if not illegal. ” According to Harley, “many women were receiving 12% less than their male counterparts for the exact same work. When I asked why we were paying women professors less, the answer I got was that ‘women take less money, which leaves more money for other things. ’” Other measures included creation of a College of Leadership and Ethics at the Newport school, increasing the racial diversity of faculty and staff, and raising salaries for older professors hired long ago. These professors for years had received only cost-of-living increases, which left them with salaries lower than more recently hired professors who joined the faculty at more modern rates.  “Ageism” is how Harley described those salary inequities.  FDA: China's coronavirus might disrupt 'critical medical products' including drugs and devices 'I can now move on' The changes, outlined in a four-year strategic plan, received support from the Navy and many Naval War College faculty and employees. But others objected, apparently including what the AP described as “a small group of longtime college employees [who] filed an anonymous complaint about Harley in April 2018 with the Navy’s office of the inspector general. ” Asked to react to the Dec. 23 Tentative Report, Harley told The Providence Journal: “It is deeply gratifying that the major allegations against me were unsubstantiated or not investigated. Being exonerated of the serious allegations takes a heavy burden from my shoulders. I am also glad the IG made no recommendations for punishment and that I can now move on.  “This has been a stressful time for my family, and I am grateful to the colleagues and friends who stood by my side during this difficult period. ” Asked to respond to the Tentative Report’s findings, Cmdr. Gary Ross, public affairs officer for the Naval War College, said “it would be inappropriate for me to comment on an ongoing investigation. ” Former San Francisco 49ers owner pardoned: Trump grants full pardon to Eddie DeBartolo Jr.  'He tried to make a difference' In interviews with The Providence Journal, Naval War College professors Sarah C. M. Paine and Bruce A. Elleman criticized Harley’s treatment by the Navy and his portrayal in the media. Before speaking, each emphasized they were expressing their personal opinions, not necessarily those of the Navy, the Naval War College or the Department of Defense.  Paine, the William S. Sims University Professor of History and Grand Strategy, has taught at the U. S. Naval War College since 2000 and holds a master’s degree from Middlebury College and a doctoral degree from Columbia. Elleman, currently the William V. Pratt Professor of International History, also has been at the Naval War College for two decades. He holds a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and a doctorate from Columbia.  Harley, Paine said, “was trying to set high standards. He tried to make a difference. ” One difference, Paine and Elleman said, was increasing the salaries of “civilian” professors such as themselves, who did not serve in the military but hold doctoral degrees and have been professionally published, so that the Naval War College would be more competitive with leading civilian universities.  Salaries of female faculty members were also matched to their male counterparts. Increased salaries would also potentially appeal to professors at other institutions who might want to join the Naval War College faculty.  The Naval War College is accredited as a master’s degree-conferring school by the New England Commission of Higher Education, which assesses colleges and universities in the six New England states and “is recognized by the U. S. Secretary of Education as a reliable authority on the quality of education for the institutions it accredits,” according to the NECHE site.  Elleman said Harley was concerned that continuing accreditation could be jeopardized by the fact that some of the War College’s “military” professors – retired service people who are also on the faculty – do not hold so-called terminal degrees, typically doctorates. In Harley’s changes, some would be required to earn such degrees, requiring additional schooling some did not want to pursue, Elleman said.  The situation was compounded, Elleman said, by what he described as a “double-dipping” salary structure. Under the Fiscal 2000 defense authorization act, signed into law in October 2000 by President Bill Clinton, retired military officers can collect their retirement and also a salary at the Naval War College.  “Currently, over 100 NWC faculty without Ph. D. s or other terminal degree are earning well over $200,000 per year, and some over $250,000 a year,” Elleman told The Providence Journal. “The ex-military bureaucracy does not support the financial needs of the civilian professors. Harley was fixing that.  “He gave salary increases to civilian professors. This is the main problem Harley was trying to solve. This is why, in my opinion, he was given a headshot. ” Elleman said that five or six years ago at the Naval War College, “the lowest full professor salary was $118,000. Now it is about $144,000. That $26,000 increase in five to six years is partly cost-of-living increases, which are automatic, but partly due to Harley. A full professor at Brown makes $158,000 for a nine-month appointment and we are on 12-month appointments; prorated at 12 months, Brown would be $210,000. ” 21 allegations in total  According to the Tentative Report, the Office of Naval Inspector General began its investigation “after receiving an anonymous complaint on April 22, 2018, that specified multiple allegations of misconduct” by Harley. Eventually, after additional claims, the Inspector General identified 21 allegations.  Two allegations involving management of the college budget were determined to “be under the purview of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASN/M&RA) and Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Financial Management and Comptroller (ASN/FM&C),” and were referred to those agencies.  “That means that the IG staff is does not have the technical expertise or background to make decisions as to whether or not this was a violation,” Harley’s Navy lawyer, Capt. Andrew House, told The Providence Journal.  Harley maintains that the “checks and balances that exist in the government comptroller system” would have made budget mismanagement “not really possible . . . claims of overspending are also not possible, because additional funding, if required, has to be coordinated and approved by our chain of command. ” The Navy budgetary divisions have not reported on their reviews.  Twelve allegations were determined to be “unsubstantiated. ” Seven were substantiated.  A misunderstood sense of humor, Harley alleges Among the 12 unsubstantiated allegations were claims that Harley “improperly directed the use of government funds for trips and lectures to the NWC” by a person whose name was redacted in the Tentative Report; “improperly solicited and accepted a $443. 64 gift from the Naval War College Foundation,” or NWCF; and “showed undue favoritism towards [name redacted]. ” Also unsubstantiated were allegations that Harley “abused his authority as President, NWC, when he directed the appointment without competition of [name redacted]""; “improperly authorized [name redacted] to attend meetings on behalf of the NWC”; and “improperly solicited gifts from foreign governments in violation of” a Defense Department Directive.  The seven substantiated findings, which Harley has contested, include that he “improperly endorsed the NWCF and encouraged NWC students to become members of the NWCF”; “improperly used his non-Government email for official Government business”; and “failed to report a potential compromise of classified information incorporated into an unclassified dissertation/blog posting. ” Also, that Harley “wrongfully served and served alcohol on the NWC campus without proper authorization. ” This related to the “margarita machine. ” Harley said this was actually a blender that was used, rarely, to mix drinks for staff or faculty.  The implication was “that I was drinking on the job,” Harley said, but “the truth is that every commander is designated authority to authorize consumption of alcohol at events on a rare and occasional basis. I did just that, with my personal staff, or travel team, or a group that might be celebrating an event. I would guess this was every four to five months on average.  “And yes, once or twice – in three years, mind you – we would have sodas and margaritas with staff members for camaraderie, as is authorized. ” The AP cited emails Harley sent to “hundreds of students, faculty and staff that raised eyebrows, including offers of ‘free hugs’ and games of Twister in his office. ” Harley told The Providence Journal that such a reaction suggests some did not understand his sense of humor, which he describes as “quirky,” and which some at the college found refreshing, but which apparently disturbed others. The intent of his humor, he said, was to build fraternity and reduce stress.  “Claims of inappropriate personal behavior like ‘hugging’ and ‘playing Twister’ were based on emails I sent in which I used humor to break down barriers,” Harley said.  One, dated Aug. 20, 2018, had “Open Door” in the subject line.  “Team – I am in the office today with nothing on the schedule due to a change in travel plans,” it began. “Feel free to stop by for coffee or to chat, commiserate, read books, sing songs, sign paperwork, and/or play twister. Hula hoop wouldn’t fit in the car. ” Another, sent on Oct. 10, 2017, invited the “team” to join him at the Newport Officer’s Club, or “The O Club,” as it is known.  “I will buy some pitchers of ice cold coca cola and some Newport Storm [beer] and a few plates of Nachos and the like,” the email read. “There will be free camaraderie. . . You can ask for a raise (no promises). . . I offer free hugs. . . We can celebrate passing our fitness test and surviving our flu shots. . . Faculty and staff and students and friends and kids are welcome. . . We can solve the North Korea problem (no promises). . . We can let our hair down (mine already is). . . ” Harley, who is bald, told The Providence Journal: “I think this is pretty obvious that this is humor and certainly not inappropriate behavior. ” So, too, the Aug. 20, 2018, Twister remark, Harley said.  “It would be really difficult for so many elderly men to play Twister in the first place without getting seriously hurt,” he said.  Harley’s Navy career began in 1979, when he enlisted in the service after graduating from high school in his native Michigan.  “We were very poor, and the Navy offered a lot of opportunities to learn a trade and participate in some sort of G. I. Bill,” Harley said in a 2017 Providence Journal profile. He became an electronics technician, but soon wanted more.  “I liked fixing radios, but I felt like I could provide some leadership and be trained to help others,” he said.  Seeing promise, the Navy sent him to the University of Minnesota, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and began a climb through the Navy officer ranks.  Harley’s official Navy biography notes his two master’s degrees and his assignments on destroyers, frigates and cruisers, including command of the USS Milius and commander of Destroyer Squadron 9. Milius, a guided-missile destroyer, supported combat operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom, which began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq and resulted in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.  Harley’s last shoreside assignment before becoming Naval War College president was deputy chief of naval operations for operations, plans and strategy.  States the biography, last updated on Jan. 8: “His personal awards include the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star (accepted on behalf of his crew), Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. ” Harley’s Navy lawyer, Capt. House, agreed to speak with The Providence Journal after emphasizing that his comments were his personal opinion and that he could not violate attorney-client privilege.  “Yes, there are some violations that have, at least at this point, been sustained,” House said. “But a number of them are somewhat technical. Some of them could be argued to be one person’s judgment versus the other. ” What would not have fit this category, House said, were many of the dismissed allegations.  “Some of the worst stuff in my opinion would have been abusing discretion in hiring or improper relationships with people or taking inappropriate gifts, and none of that was validated by the evidence,” House said. “I would say a number of these allegations will come down to Admiral Harley made a decision and there are people who disagree with that decision. I don’t think anything he did was out of malice or dereliction of duty or intent to do anything wrong. ” House added: “He’s had a tremendous career. If there were issues about his judgment and character and integrity, it would be surprising to me that he would have risen to the rank of rear admiral and would have been put in charge of the Naval War College. ” Said Harley: “I sometimes wonder if it was worth trying to move an entrenched organization so quickly. But then I know it was my duty to keep the college relevant and make the changes I did, even if I had to pay the price of leadership.  “I therefore, on reflection, would not have changed a single thing. ” Follow reporter G.

| Jump to first hitSIOUX FALLS, S. D. – It's 6 p. m. on a Wednesday, and Greg and Denise Patton are wedging a vial full of bedbugs between their couch cushions.  ""You had bedbugs in this couch?"" Denise says, the most common question she gets from guests. ""It always requires that we explain what's going on . . . sometimes we don't think to tell people they're in vials. "" It's something the couple has done since they started Dakota Bedbug Detection in 2011.  Around that time Denise, an entomologist with the city and self-described ""bug person"" said she'd been hearing more and more questions from friends concerned about bedbugs.  It felt like there was something they could do to help, she thought, and a new business was born.  Most people might not know, Denise said, that their job detecting bedbugs is ""about 50% counseling. "" Not everyone is a bug person like she is.  ""It literally brings them to tears,"" she said about some people's reaction to bedbugs. ""Not understanding things about the bugs can be super terrifying. "" Texas school board starts 'new age of understanding': Drops Confederate song 'Dixie' after years of criticism How do they find the bedbugs?  After some research (as well as a healthy dose of convincing Greg, a business professor who ""hates bugs"") Denise came across IronHeart Training Center.  IronHeart trains dogs to find drugs, bombs, accelerants, mold, termites, currency and, of course, bedbugs.  And that's where they found Bo, an energetic beagle who can sniff out the insects with the best of them. It's also where they got another beagle, the calmer B. G. , a few years later.  To be ready to head off to a handler, it takes about four to six months of training, said Matt Skogen, IronHeart's director of training, but it doesn't stop there. Regular maintenance training is needed to ensure the dog stays at the top of their game.  And that's why almost every day, Bo and B. G. put on their green work vests, get leashed up and search their home for bedbugs.  When they're working for real, they've checked houses, hotels, apartment complexes, nursing homes, dorms and more. Some of their visits are regular preventive checks; some are homeowners who suspect an issue but want to be sure.  Whether it's practice or a real job, hunting for bedbugs involves both dog and handler.  Denise or Greg walk around with a metal pointer, constantly tapping the areas that Bo or B. G. should be searching.  It has to be a fairly directed approach, because the dog will need to get within 6-8 inches of a bedbug in order to smell it, Denise said.  Once they smell a bedbug – and they can smell a single one, in any stage of life – they'll immediately sit, as well as expect a treat.  Most coffee makers are crawling with germs and growing mold: Here's why How the Pattons keep bedbugs in their home It's a good thing that the dogs have to get close to smell bedbugs – because the Patton home is also often the home of ""the colony,"" a collection of 5,000 to 10,000 bedbugs that live in three Mason jars.  Of course, if you want to keep that many bedbugs alive, they're going to need to eat.  Bedbugs want to feed on warm, oxygenated blood. The trainers at IronHeart had used pinky mice – what you might feed a snake – but Denise and Greg had trouble finding enough.  But, Denise realized, there was already a source of warm, oxygenated blood: herself.  The bedbug-filled jars, which have medical mesh stretched over the top, are flipped over and Denise places them onto her forearm. The bugs are able to feed through the mesh without escaping.  It's a little strange, yeah. But she's not in any danger – while bedbugs can carry disease, they can't spread it.  From that same colony, they'll even sell bedbugs to researchers or other companies training dogs (and they'll check to make sure you're not someone looking to plant them in a hotel to get a free room. ) More than anything, Denise and Greg just want to help people. Sure, they might not make everyone ""bug people. "" But you can get them less fearful, less worried.  Because there can be a stigma around bedbugs as well, Denise said, one that can prevent people from looking for help in a belief that if they have bedbugs they've done something wrong, or they're not clean.  But it's not true, she said. Rich, poor, clean, dirty, it doesn't matter. Anyone can be affected by bedbugs, she said.  ""It's not anything to be ashamed of,"" she said.

| Jump to first hitAlabama Columbiana: A proposed toll bridge over Lay Lake that could spur economic development in central Alabama is drawing concerns from some residents and environmentalists. Some who live near the site on the Shelby-Talladega county line are worried about noise and traffic should the bridge be built, and the Alabama Rivers Alliance has raised questions about issues with construction and the long-term impact of quality of life in the area. Businessman Tim James proposed the bridge, which would link the counties across the Coosa River. He told WIAT-TV some noise is a small trade-off for the historic economic development a toll bridge would bring. A public involvement meeting is scheduled for Tuesday on the bridge, which has become a topic of discussion for state lawmakers as well. Last Wednesday, a bill was introduced that would require voter approval in counties considering toll bridges.  Alaska Juneau: More than 200 federally recognized tribes would also be officially recognized in the state under a bill that is gaining momentum with bipartisan support. The bill is largely symbolic and would not change how tribal governments already operate, as each of the 229 Native Alaska tribes is already federally recognized, lawmakers said. The legislation would instead enshrine in state law what has been the status of these tribes for years and formally recognize tribal sovereignty. “Just a simple act of recognition can heal decades of hurt,” said Richard Chalyee Eesh Peterson, president of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska. “One of the things that will happen for the larger community of Alaska, this will normalize the thought of tribes as sovereigns. ” Arizona Tombstone: Doc Holliday’s Saloon has challenged the state liquor department’s ruling that the saloon didn’t adequately control firearms within its establishment. That claim, historians will note, was the also the chief concern of the bar’s namesake, John Henry “Doc” Holliday, when he lived in Tombstone in the late 1800s. That dispute, in which Holliday and three other lawmen looked to disarm a group of cowboys by the OK Corral, ended badly. In the current case, the liquor department ordered Doc Holliday’s to temporarily close its swinging doors for two weeks because of four incidents that it asserted violated liquor laws. Three involved weapons; two ended with someone being shot. After one shooting incident, the department’s report noted, the saloon seemed to celebrate with a sign outside that suggested beer was a necessity following a shooting. Doc Holliday remains open for business while it appeals the order.  Arkansas Mountain Home: The city will hold a public meeting at 6 p. m. Tuesday at City Hall to discuss a proposed community center. Under a proposal presented to the City Council earlier this month, the facility would include an indoor aquatic center and an outdoor water park in addition to the community center. It would be built at McCabe Park along U. S. Highway 62 West. The plan includes upgrades or renovations – some big, some small – to almost every park under the City of Mountain Home umbrella and carries an estimated $38 million price tag. The proposed indoor aquatic center would be 22,300 square feet and include a competition lap pool, a heated therapy pool and a kids’ play pool. The proposed outdoor water park would feature a diving pool, a shallow play area for small children, water slides and a lazy river.  California Lake Elsinore: Southern California’s dry winter isn’t good for wildflowers – and that’s OK with officials in this city where last spring’s “superbloom” of poppies drew huge crowds. Riverside County parks official Dustin McLain said the chances of a superbloom in Walker Canyon this year are small because January was dry, and February has started off the same way, The Press-Enterprise reports. Lake Elsinore Mayor Brian Tisdale is hoping the big bloom doesn’t occur. “That kind of attention – even though it’s probably the most beautiful thing in Southern California – has an overwhelming impact on the local community,” he told the newspaper. Last March, after a very wet winter, throngs of people flocked to Walker Canyon. Interstate 15 was jammed for miles in both directions, and streets of the small city were gridlocked. At one point, the city closed the canyon and then barred cars from the area, requiring visitors to pay for shuttle rides to the floral extravaganza.  Colorado Denver: A ban prohibiting pit bulls in the city is expected to remain in place after the mayor announced plans to veto legislation that would have lifted the dog breed restriction. Mayor Michael Hancock said Friday that he expects to veto a repeal on the ban, citing concerns that the ordinance does not fully address the risk of injury resulting from attacks from these particular dog breeds, the Denver Post reports. “The reality is that irresponsible pet owners continue to be a problem, and it is the irresponsible owners and their dogs I must consider in evaluating the overall impact of this ordinance,” Hancock said. City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday and must acquire nine votes to override the veto, but the repeal measure only passed the council with seven votes when first introduced, city officials said.  Connecticut New Haven: A female high school student defeated a transgender female athlete in a state championship race, just two days after a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block transgender athletes from participating in girls sports in the state. Chelsea Mitchell, of Canton High School, won the Class S 55-meter dash title Friday night with a time of 7. 18 seconds, edging Terry Miller of Bloomfield High School. Miller, a transgender athlete, finished at 7. 20 seconds. The families of Mitchell and two other female high school runners filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday, arguing that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete has deprived them of track titles and scholarship opportunities. The Hartford Courant reports Miller and Mitchell did not interact before or after the race. “I clapped because, for me, I’m not a hater,” Miller said. “When you take a win, you take the win. And even if you don’t respect me, I’ll respect you. ” Delaware Wilmington: The air temperature was hanging around freezing when 130 people stepped out of the The Queen Wilmington over the weekend for the second annual Cupid’s Undie Run, most only in their skivvies. The outdoor portion of the event, the namesake run, took panty- or boxer-clad participants on a jog from 5th Street to 10th Street and back to the warm Queen on Saturday. “It’s a fun run, so people run in their underwear or a costume,” organizer Caroline Mouldsdale said, adding that the pre-run partying inside The Queen made the cold a little easier to handle. “It’s a little chilly, but we’ve been dancing and having fun. ” The run is in its 10th year nationwide, Mouldsdale said. It’s earned $18 million for the Children’s Tumor Foundation, which is seeking a cure for neurofibromatosis. “The founders who came up with the Cupid’s Undie Run decided if these children (with neurofibromatosis) were going to uncomfortable in their skin every day, then we can go out and be uncomfortable in our skin,” she said.  District of Columbia Washington: Momentum is building in the nation’s capital for the creation of a museum dedicated to American women’s history, WUSA-TV reports. The House has passed a bill to establish the museum inside the Smithsonian network and take steps toward funding and construction. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N. C. , was the main sponsor of the Smithsonian Women’s History Museum Act. 374 Congress members voted for the House bill, while only 37 voted against it. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate. If approved, it could take a decade or more to finalize funding, design and construction of the museum.  Florida Fort Lauderdale: Officials say 211. 6 million gallons of sewage has spilled into city waterways in the past few months. The Sun-Sentinel reports that’s enough to fill 320 Olympic-sized pools. The city’s aging sewer pipes broke six times in December and spewed 126. 9 million gallons of sewage – ranking as one of South Florida’s biggest spills ever. The spills fouled the Tarpon River, the Himmarshee Canal and streets in three neighborhoods. According to what officials told the state Department of Environmental Protection, 79. 3 million gallons spilled into George English Lake over a 10-day period that began Jan. 30 and ended Feb. 8. Then an additional 5. 4 million gallons flooded streets near a park right across from a popular mall. In recent weeks, crews also have rushed to fix another string of water main breaks, forcing the city to warn residents to boil their tap water before drinking, brushing their teeth or washing dishes.  Georgia Atlanta: The demand for parking at the nation’s busiest airport has declined with the rise of Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services, airport officials say. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is shelving plans to demolish and rebuild its parking decks at the domestic terminal. The airport developed plans several years ago to double the size of the Terminal South and Terminal North decks, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. But airport officials eventually downscaled those plans. Airport parking revenue had begun to decline in 2019, Hartsfield-Jackson General Manager John Selden said at the time. Last week, Selden told a City Council committee that revenue has continued to decrease. Airport car rentals also have declined, he said. “People are just not parking,” he said.  Hawaii Honolulu: Possession of small amounts of drugs that are considered dangerous would be decriminalized in the state under a proposed bill, potentially reducing the amount of money spent on enforcement. The legislation would make it a misdemeanor instead of a felony offense to possess less than 2 grams of dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine, heroin, morphine and cocaine. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing Friday, after which the bill was amended to increase the amount of drugs from one-sixteenth of an ounce to 2 grams, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Enforcement of the offense of promotion of a dangerous drug in the third-degree costs state taxpayers over $13 million each year to incarcerate low-level, non-violent offenders,” the bill says. “Hawaii’s experience corroborates mounting national data demonstrating that incarceration has no effect on rates of drug use or overdose deaths, but actually increases recidivism among those at low risk to reoffend. ”  Idaho Boise: An Idaho Transportation Department employee died as he worked along U. S. Highway 20 in southeast Idaho. Mark Reinke, 56, was killed Thursday when his backhoe was struck from behind by a semitractor about 5 miles outside Arco, the Idaho Statesman reports. The semi was traveling west. Reinke was wearing a seat belt but was fatally injured. He died about 7 a. m. , the department announced in a press release. Reinke began working for the Idaho Transportation Department last summer. He is the 40th employee to die on the job since 1960.  Illinois Chicago: Nearly a dozen public housing authorities in the area will receive $75 million in federal funding for development, financing and modernization, federal officials said. The money is coming through a capital program of the U. S. Department of Housing and Development. The bulk of the funding, nearly $65 million, will go to the Chicago Housing Authority. Other recipients including housing authorities in Joliet, Aurora, North Chicago, Waukegan, Kankakee and Oak Park. “This federal funding gives local agencies in the Chicagoland region the ability to offer safe and affordable housing to those who need it most,” U. S. Sen. Dick Durbin said in a joint news release with U. S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth. “In addition, the local economy stands to benefit from this investment in infrastructure projects that will bring safety and modernization to the area’s public housing. ”  Indiana Indianapolis: Road crews are getting a new weapon in their endless task of filling potholes: special heaters that should make their road-patching chores easier, especially in cold weather. The city’s Department of Public Works recently acquired two infrared P200 asphalt heaters to assist with road repairs. The new machinery essentially heats up the asphalt, making it easier for crews to fix segments of pavement that are falling apart. The department says the machinery will heat dry pavement to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing crews to remove buckled or decaying asphalt and smooth it over more effortlessly. Workers will pull the heaters behind their trucks so they can cover long swaths at a time. “We’re excited to continue putting tools in the hands of our street maintenance crews that go above and beyond simple filling operations,” DPW Director Dan Parker said in a news release. The machinery is being tested and will be used on roads in the coming weeks.  Iowa Clayton: A northeast Iowa company that wanted to withdraw 2 billion gallons of water annually from the Jordan aquifer to send to drought-stricken western states has pulled its permit request. Pattison Sand Co. notified the state Department of Natural Resources on Feb. 12 that it was pulling its permit request, which had garnered significant concern from lawmakers and environmental groups. Before the Pattison proposal, the agency had never received a request to move so much water outside of the state, the Iowa DNR said, although it has allowed rural water groups to serve communities across the border in neighboring states. The Iowa DNR wrote Pattison in a Feb. 4 letter that the agency planned to reject the request, saying it would have “a negative impact on the long-term availability of Iowa’s water resources. ” Kansas Topeka: The state’s elections chief is pushing to make Kansas’ central voter registration database more secure by changing how counties tap into it, but some officials are nervous about what they see as a big project in a busy election year. Secretary of State Scott Schwab has told county election officials he wants them to use dedicated tablets, laptops or computers not linked to their counties’ networks to access the state’s voter registration database. He says Kansas is getting $8 million in federal election security funds that could be used to cover the costs. Schwab, a Republican and former Kansas House member from the Kansas City area who became the state’s top elections official last year, contends such a setup will decrease the likelihood of foreign nationals, foreign governments or domestic hackers gaining access to voter registration records. His idea has bipartisan support. But even some county election officials who agree Schwab’s initiative would make voter registration records more secure see it as a huge undertaking.  Kentucky Frankfort: State transportation officials will be out more than $150,000 after losing a legal battle to a man who wanted to put “IM GOD” on his license plate. In November, a federal judge in Frankfort gave Ben Hart the OK to get the controversial license plate after a three-year legal battle against the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Hart applied for the license in 2016 but was denied because it didn’t “meet requirements. ” Kentucky statute allows for personalized license plates as long as the letters do not discriminate against anyone because of their sex, race, color, religion or nationality. In Hart’s case, the court ruled that vanity plates were private speech and therefore protected by the First Amendment. On Monday, a judge ordered the defendants in Hart’s case to pay out $150,715. 50 in lawyer fees and another $491. 24 for additional court costs.  Louisiana Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University’s Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow has a new honor to add to his long list of awards and achievements: He inspired the name of the newest male giraffe at the capital city’s zoo. A public naming competition selected the name Burreaux – a Cajun-inspired spelling of Burrow’s last name – for the giraffe calf born Dec. 26. The Baton Rouge Zoo announced the selection Friday, saying the public chose the winning name from three options: Romeo, Burreaux and Kiume, a Swahili word meaning masculine and strong. Zoo staff took nominations for the names and narrowed them to the finalists. The public voted with donations, which the zoo said raised more than $2,000 that will go to its conservation efforts. Burrow is LSU’s most decorated quarterback, leading the Tigers to a national championship victory earlier this year. He’s widely expected to be the top player taken in the 2020 NFL draft.  Maine Bar Harbor: The new executive director of a museum dedicated to the indigenous people of Maine is a professional educator and member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe. The Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor will be led by Christopher Newell, the museum’s trustees announced last week. The museum documents Wabanaki culture, history and art. Newell was born and raised in Indian Township, Maine, and worked for five years as education supervisor for the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut. He also served as senior adviser on the documentary “Dawnland,” which focused on the Maine-Wabanaki State Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Abbe Museum was founded in 1926 and is also the site of the annual Abbe Museum Indian Market in Bar Harbor.  Maryland Glen Burnie: Police have arrested a woman suspected of throwing a Molotov cocktail into a place of worship for Jehovah’s Witnesses, according to court records. Heather Meisel, 43, was charged Friday after she told investigators she damaged the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Glen Burnie to “send a message,” the Capital Gazette reports. Meisel, a Baltimore County resident, was arrested on charges including attempted murder and defacement of religious property. Anne Arundel County fire investigators found a door with broken glass and a Molotov cocktail made from an apple cider vinegar bottle inside the building Thursday morning. Police estimated the incident caused more than $1,000 in damage to the building’s front door and more than $1,000 in damage to property inside the building. Meisel resisted arrest and told officers she was “royalty,” charging documents said.  Massachusetts Boston: A bill making its way through the Statehouse would require schools to provide free disposable menstrual products to students. Under the proposal, all “elementary and secondary public schools in the commonwealth serving students in any grade from grade six through grade twelve shall provide disposable menstrual products in the restrooms” of school buildings. The products would be provided at no charge. The bill also requires school districts to make sure the products “shall be available in a convenient manner that does not stigmatize any student seeking such product. ” The bill has received the backing of the Legislature’s Education Committee but has yet to come up for a vote in either the Massachusetts House or Senate. Advocates say the availability of free pads and tampons in schools helps chip away at any stigma surrounding the products and makes the products available to students who may not be able to afford them.  Michigan Lansing: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is urging businesses to give their workers the day off on Election Day by making it a company holiday. Benson said she’s encouraging companies to give employees the day off work Nov. 3 so they can vote and work as poll workers. She praised Wayne State University for recently announcing such a move, MLive. com reports. “That’s the direction we should be moving in,” Benson said. State Rep. Darrin Camilleri, D-Brownstown, has a bill pending before the Legislature that would make regularly scheduled election days in May, August and November state holidays. When the state makes days like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents Day state holidays, he said, “many other businesses end up following suit. ” “I think that we want to make it as broad as possible, as easy as possible for people to participate in our elections,” Camilleri said.  Minnesota St. Paul: The GOP minority in the state House announced a slate of bills Monday aimed at reducing violent crime in Minneapolis and St. Paul and on the Metro Transit system, drawing a sharp retort from Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The proposals include higher penalties for gang members who use guns in crimes, boosting funding against gangs and drug trafficking, requiring major sports and entertainment venues to have sufficient police nearby, and increased enforcement on the light rail system. House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, of Crown, and other Republican leaders said at a news conference that their constituents from greater Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs worry about their safety when attending sporting and entertainment events in the cities. Frey accused the Republican lawmakers of trying to make public safety a partisan issue and of spreading misinformation while providing too little financial assistance.  Mississippi Biloxi: The first part of the state’s recreational red snapper season will run from May 22 through July 12. A midseason closure will let the Department of Marine Resources and the related commission analyze data and decide how to manage the remaining quota, officials said in a news release Wednesday. Mississippi is allocating 151,500 pounds of the popular sport and table fish – about 3. 5% of the total quota for private anglers in the Gulf of Mexico, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries. Private anglers with the appropriate Mississippi licenses can fish in federal waters off the state’s coast. Recreational charter boats with Mississippi licenses are restricted to state waters because federal authorities still regulate for-hire boats in federal waters.  Missouri Springfield: The Missouri Pork Association and Missouri Farm Bureau say they support the state conservation department’s approach to trying to eradicate feral hogs. Don Nikodim, director of Missouri Pork Association, said Friday that the association backs the Missouri Department of Conservation’s emphasis on trapping feral hogs rather than opening MDC lands for hunting the destructive animals. MDC banned feral hog hunting on its properties in 2016, a controversial move that’s been opposed by many hunters and landowners. Nikodim said he believes MDC is making good progress with its trapping efforts, although the agency could use more trapping teams to be even more effective. In its 2020 policy statement, the Missouri Farm Bureau also says it supports federal and state feral hog eradication efforts in Missouri. “We believe feral hogs are an unacceptable risk to humans, livestock, crops, and property. We believe eradication of all feral hogs is the ultimate goal,” the Farm Bureau says on its website.  Montana Great Falls: Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials have been confronted over the past several months by a recurring problem of graffiti at numerous parks and recreational facilities around Cascade County. The department is now seeking the public’s help in identifying who’s responsible for the vandalism. Spray-painted blue and red hearts began appearing last August at six locations, including Giant Springs, Sluice Boxes and the First Peoples’ Buffalo Jump state parks. The damage has now been cataloged in 10 areas and has expanded to include an image of a palmetto tree and a crescent, similar to the South Carolina state flag. “It’s been pretty consistent with the blue hearts and the red hearts,” said FWP Game Warden Kqyn Kuka. “Then recently there’s been this new image. We don’t know if they’re related or not, but it’s the same color paint, so I’m assuming they’re connected. ” The graffiti is typically located in high, remote locations – difficult to access but clearly visible to the general public.  Nebraska Ericson: State banking officials have closed Ericson State Bank in north-central Nebraska, declaring it insolvent. The Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance announced the closure in a news release Friday night, saying it had named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver of the bank. To protect depositors, the FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Farmers and Merchants Bank in Milford to assume all of the deposits of Ericson State Bank. Ericson bank will be open for business Tuesday under the name Farmers and Merchants Bank, the release says. Ericson State Bank account holders can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards, the department said. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed, and loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.  Nevada Las Vegas: Officials say the number of weddings in Clark County has been declining. The county had 73,000 weddings last year – more than a 40% drop from 2004, when 128,000 ceremonies occurred. County Clerk Lynn Goya cites an overall decline in advertising to push the industry and available options for consumers. Authorities tell Las Vegas TV station KVVU that some initiatives to push wedding tourism in the county include the possible creation of a “Wedding Way” from the Neon Museum to the Strat, allocating development funds to historic chapels for renovations, and a Wedding Walk of Fame to showcase famous celebrity weddings. Other campaigns include wedding photography contests, personal testimonies from married couples and a dive into the history of Vegas weddings.  New Hampshire Concord: It’s time to count the turkeys again. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department is asking the public to report sightings of wild turkeys through March 31 for its annual winter flock survey. Last year, the department got 486 reports totaling 9,833 birds. Officials say that was fewer than the previous year, likely because turkeys were on the move. With relatively little snow, turkeys were able to move around more and weren’t staying in one place to be counted. Participants are asked to report the number of turkeys in the flock, their location, the type of habitat in which the birds were observed and on what the turkeys were feeding. Officials also are interested in any signs of two viruses that have appeared in turkeys in recent years, with symptoms including warty protuberances in the head and eye area. Wild turkeys had disappeared from the state after over-hunting and habitat loss in the 1800s but have rebounded to an estimated population of 40,000.  New Jersey Elizabeth: Officials say they are “trying to rebuild” following a fire that ripped through a church that dates back almost a century and a half. Robert Ingram, who organized a GoFundMe campaign, said everything had been lost in the “devastating and tragic” blaze early Sunday at Shiloh Baptist Church. “Instead of waking up and being able to go to church, we woke up to this,” Ingram said. “Now we’re trying to rebuild. ” Chief Thomas McNamara of the city’s fire department said the church was “pretty much destroyed. ” Arriving fire crews reported the church fully engulfed in flames, and the back of the structure collapsed as crews worked to try to protect nearby buildings, officials said. The church’s Facebook page lists its founding date as November 1879. Gov. Phil Murphy said in a message on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the fire and expressed thanks to first responders. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  New Mexico Albuquerque: Statistics show accidental shootings are on the rise in the city. The Albuquerque Journal reports 37 accidental shootings reported last year compared to 14 recorded in 2018. The figure doesn’t include three suspected accidental shootings in which someone died. Two of those cases have been handed over to the District Attorney’s Office for a final determination, and the third ended in prison time for a young man. The rise in accidental shootings comes at a time when the topic of gun access and availability looms large in the eyes of local politicians and the community as a whole as homicide numbers in Albuquerque hit a record high last year. Local concerns have sparked initiatives aimed at stemming gun violence, such as the so-called red flag bill that is awaiting the governor’s signature. Local gun shop owners say there has been an increase in the purchase of guns in the past year, especially over the internet.  New York New York: A judge has ordered the developers of an under-construction condo tower to remove several floors from the top of the building because it is too tall. State Supreme Court Justice W. Franc Perry’s ruling last week instructs the Department of Buildings to revoke the building permit for the nearly completed tower on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and remove floors that exceed the zoning limit, The New York Times reports. The number of floors to be removed from the 52-story tower is not yet known, but the newspaper said it could be 20 or more. A lawyer representing the project said the developers would appeal the Feb. 13 decision. The building’s 112 luxury apartments are now being marketed, including a $21 million penthouse, which would likely be removed if the decision stands, the Times reports.  North Carolina Ocracoke: This island on North Carolina’s Outer Banks that was ravaged by a hurricane last year is getting $2 million in grants to help it rebuild. The Virginian-Pilot reports Ocracoke received the grant money from the Golden Leaf Foundation, a nonprofit that was established from a tobacco settlement to help the state’s rural and economically distressed communities. Hurricane Dorian pummeled Ocracoke in September with the worst flooding on record. Most of the buildings on the island were damaged. The island’s only school received $900,000 to help rebuild and elevate buildings. The foundation also provided half a million dollars to build a new emergency medical building that was flooded. And Hyde County received $277,400 to repair the Ocracoke Seafood Co. building. The Ocracoke Seafood Co. is owned by a nonprofit organization that serves as the base for more than 30 watermen.  North Dakota Fargo: A freshman congressman who spent much of his first term defending President Donald Trump during impeachment hearings said Monday that he wants to return to Washington and begin working on practical issues. Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong formally announced his reelection bid Monday by telling supporters he’ll work with Democrats on bills involving prescription drug prices, immigration and criminal justice reform. The state’s lone House member said he won’t budge on support for gun rights and opposition to abortion and federal regulations that would stifle North Dakota’s energy and agriculture sectors. Armstrong predicted that voters will opt for Republican majorities in the House and Senate and give Trump another four years.  Ohio Kent: Jane Fonda is among the speakers tapped to mark the 50th anniversary of the Kent State shootings. The 82-year-old actress and activist will highlight four days of events the university has planned to explore the lasting impacts of the events of May 4, 1970, which were considered pivotal in turning public sentiment against the Vietnam War. On that day, the Ohio National Guard fired on students during an anti-war protest, killing four and injuring nine others. Fonda was one of the most prominent figures of the anti-war movement, though also one of the most divisive. Fonda plans to reflect on that era, her life in social activism and the legacy of the Kent State shootings during her speech May 3. The event is free and open to the public, but tickets must be reserved in advance. The commemoration marks the first time students, faculty, university staff and leadership, and May 4 survivors and family members have united around the idea that the date should be forever honored, planners said.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: The venerable Red Earth Festival is leaving the city even as organizers plan to launch a new event downtown, as well as a series of statewide collaborative celebrations of Native American art and culture. Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell and Mayor David Holt joined members of the staff and board of directors of the nonprofit Red Earth Inc. on Monday morning to reveal the changes. The organization’s marquee event – the long-running Red Earth Festival, an intertribal celebration of Native American visual art, dance and culture – will move from its longtime home in downtown Oklahoma City to the Grand Event Center at the Grand Casino Hotel & Resort in Shawnee for its 2020 edition, scheduled for June 13-14. A favorite aspect of the summer festival, the popular Red Earth Parade, will be staying in Oklahoma City but shifting to autumn, as Red Earth Inc. will launch a significant new event to mark Oklahoma City’s Indigenous Peoples Day.  Oregon Salem: Officials at the Oregon Department of Forestry say just seven months into the state’s two-year budget cycle, they’ve spent most of the money lawmakers approved for the entire biennium and now need an emergency cash infusion. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports agency officials say they need between $52 million and $132 million, or they’ll have exhausted their budget by March. The request comes as lawmakers and the governor are looking to expand the agency even further, sponsoring bills that would bolster the agency’s firefighting capabilities and forest restoration work – above and beyond the immediate budget requests. In the near term, agency leaders are looking for a minimum of $52 million and as much as $132 million, money they say is needed to keep keep regular programs running; to pay a consultant hired to help them get their financial house in order; and to cover firefighting costs in the upcoming 2020 fire season.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: Outdoorsy Pennsylvanians can soon keep their fishing license in a pocket rather than having to attach it to an outer garment. The regulation amendment approved recently by the board of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission adjusts a long-standing rule on license display. The new policy goes into effect once it is published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The executive director of the commission, Tim Schaeffer, said the change will make things more convenient for anglers and decrease the number of lost licenses and the personal cost that goes into replacing them. The change also aligns fishing display regulations with those of hunting licenses.  Rhode Island Providence: British actor and comedian John Cleese, who once portrayed an inept hotel manager in the series “Fawlty Towers,” has complained about his treatment at a Rhode Island hotel. Cleese, 80, tweeted Sunday to his 5. 7 million followers that he was cold inside his room at the Omni Providence Hotel and that the hotel staff could do nothing to help him. He later posted that his tweeting had worked and that the hotel had fixed the problem. The hotel told the Providence Journal its engineering staff was dispatched to resolve the issue shortly after receiving Cleese’s complaint. In “Fawlty Towers,” Cleese played the manager of a substandard English hotel who was known to express disdain toward “that annoying section of the general public who insist on staying at hotels. ” Cleese, who also is a founding member of the comedy troupe Monty Python, tweeted that he believed his problem in Providence, where he performed Sunday, was resolved because “I have the power to tweet. But NOT, of course, because I am a member of the public. So much for corporate America. ” South Carolina Union: The Union County Council voted to ask its sheriff to step down after a state police report said he requested employees to buy him alcohol while on duty and made sexually inappropriate comments. But the council has no power to fire Sheriff David Taylor, who released a statement after the vote saying he plans to serve until the end of his term in December. “I was elected by the majority of the voters to serve out my four-year term, and that is my intent,” Taylor said in a statement sent to the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg. A prosecutor who reviewed the report by the State Law Enforcement Division didn’t recommend criminal charges, saying Taylor didn’t get any personal financial benefit from his office mismanagement. Taylor said while some of the allegations in the report were true, many others weren’t. He asked for the state investigation after reports of financial problems emerged in 2018.  South Dakota Pierre: State lawmakers said they would turn their focus to the state budget this week as they hit the halfway mark in the 2020 session, though Republicans and Democrats laid out different visions of how to use that money. Legislators settled on roughly $1. 74 billion in revenue to use in setting the state budget – an increase of $19 million from Gov. Kristi Noem’s projection in December. Once combined with federal funding and other state funds, the budget will likely total more than $5 billion. But Democrats, who hold just three spots on the committee that decides the size of the budget, were not pleased with the final projections, saying Republicans were being too cautious with the estimates. Democrats want the state to fund inflationary pay increases for teachers, state employees and service care providers.  Tennessee Chattanooga: The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga plans to offer discounted tuition starting this fall to students from nine surrounding states. University officials said the goal of the new regional tuition program is to attract and retain diverse talent in the area as well as reach enrollment goals laid out for the University of Tennessee system, The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. Under the program, students from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia would pay about $18,000 a year instead of about $26,000 a year as out-of-state students. An existing program that offers tuition discounts to residents of neighboring counties in Georgia and Alabama would remain in effect. The university has an enrollment of nearly 11,700 students. About 10% of those are from outside Tennessee.  Texas Corpus Christi: A Monday morning fire at a Citgo refinery in the city was extinguished with no injuries, according to the petroleum company. The fire began in a pipeline owned by a third party shortly after 8:30 a. m. and was put out shortly before 11 a. m. with “no threat to the surrounding community,” Citgo said in a statement. The owner of the pipeline has not been identified. Corpus Christi Fire Chief Robert Rocha said the fire forced the closure of Interstate 37 in the south Texas city, but it had since reopened. People in nearby homes and businesses were ordered to shelter in place until air-quality monitoring found the air to be safe. “We’re still trying to figure out what happened,” Rocha said. “We encountered heavy fire conditions coming from a buried pipeline” after responding to the blaze. Rocha said no one was injured as a result of the fire.  Utah Salt Lake City: An important dinosaur site that has fallen into neglect would be protected as Utah’s 45th state park under a measure being proposed in the Legislature. The bill would create Utahraptor State Park in the Dalton Wells Quarry, about 15 miles north of Moab, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The quarry is where the first fossils of Utahraptor, the state’s official dinosaur, and other unique species were found. State Paleontologist Jim Kirkland said the site, west of Arches National Park, has massive deposits of dinosaur bones from at least 10 species found nowhere else in North America. “It’s a gold mine of new dinosaurs,” Kirkland said. “There are 30 that we know are only in Moab Valley. ” Grand County leaders have long wanted to safeguard the quarry. There is now unregulated recreational use in Dalton Wells, and the site has been subjected to litter and vandalism. It’s also the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps work camp that was used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II.  Vermont Montpelier: A legislative committee has approved major changes to the state’s development review law known as Act 250. The House Natural Resources Committee voted 6-3 with two members absent to approve the overhaul after more than a year of work, Vermont Public Radio reports. The bill would exempt developments in designated downtowns from Act 250 review and boost protections to wildlife connector areas. It also would require projects above 2,000 feet to undergo Act 250 review. The legislation stems from an agreement reached between Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration and Vermont Natural Resources Council, an environmental group. The bill is better because it will limit dividing Vermont’s forest through piecemeal development, said Brian Shupe, VNRC’s executive director.  Virginia Chesapeake: This southeastern Virginia city has surpassed Norfolk to become the state’s second-most-populous city. The Virginian-Pilot reports Chesapeake has reached an estimated population of 245,745 people, according to the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. Norfolk’s population is just over 245,000 residents. Chesapeake’s population has grown by more than 10% in the past decade. Norfolk’s has ticked up by less than 1%. The center estimates Richmond will also likely overtake Norfolk. Hamilton Lombard, a demographer with the Cooper Center, said one reason behind Chesapeake’s growth is that the city has lots of space for new homes, while Norfolk does not. Virginia Beach is still the state’s most populous city with an estimated 452,643 residents. The populations of the seven Hampton Roads cities constitute nearly a fifth of the state’s population.  Washington Tacoma: An Asian elephant that spent more than 20 years at Tacoma’s Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium was euthanized Saturday night after a “severe decline in her health,” zoo officials announced. Hanoko the elephant was 56, the Tacoma News Tribune reports. Veterinarians in 2018 diagnosed Hanoko with cancer and with tuberculosis in 2019. She suffered from advanced joint disease and had stopped eating her regular diet, zoo officials said. She showed signs of “significant discomfort” despite pain medication, officials said. The median life expectancy is 47 for female Asian elephants in human care, zoo officials said in the announcement, citing statistics from the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. “With Hanako’s advanced age, significant and chronic medical conditions, and severe decline in health, euthanasia was the humane decision,” said Dr. Karen Wolf, the zoo’s head veterinarian.  West Virginia Charleston: Women and lawmakers on Monday commemorated the 100th anniversary of the state’s ratification of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote. Hundreds of women attended various ceremonies at the state Capitol in Charleston. In the Rotunda, a reenactor portrayed Susan B. Anthony in a speech given during Anthony’s trial in New York for voting in an 1872 presidential election. An evening reception was planned at the state Culture Center to recognize female lawmakers. On March 10, 1920, West Virginia became the 34th state to ratify the amendment. Later that year, Tennessee provided the necessary three-fourths majority by becoming the 36th state to ratify women’s suffrage.  Wisconsin Milwaukee: Miller Park has generated $2. 5 billion for the economies of the city of Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin, according to a new study commissioned by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. The study, conducted by Conventions, Sports & Leisure International, was released Monday by the MMAC. It comes as the original Miller Park lease is in its 20th and final year, and the five-county sales tax that helped build and maintain the stadium is about to reach its sunset, long after originally expected. The study says the construction and continued operation of Miller Park generated $1. 6 billion in direct spending, a total of 1,835 in annual jobs and $1. 2 billion in personal earnings. The $2. 5 billion overall impact represents “cumulative net new impacts” that would not have been realized without the existence of the Milwaukee Brewers and Miller Park, the report says.  Wyoming Gillette: An attempt to break a world record for the most sparklers lit simultaneously failed on a technicality. Guinness World Records officials ruled each participant was required to light their own sparkler during the attempt in Gillette, The Gillette News Record reports. The August effort was part of the Pyrotechnics Guild International’s 50th annual convention. The event had an apparatus for lighting multiple sparklers, which was built by students and instructors at Gillette College. Volunteers with torches lit sparklers and distributed them to participants. More than 1,700 people attended, and 2,500 sparklers were lit. The current record is 1,713. Basic guidelines are listed on the Guinness website, but the specific guidelines were not received prior to the attempt. “It’s a bummer, but that just means we have to do it again,” says Christen Burdette of the the Campbell County Convention and Visitors Bureau.

| Jump to first hitChinese health officials acknowledged ""shortcomings and difficulties"" in their initial response to a fast-spreading new virus as the death toll soared to nearly 500 Tuesday.  The powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo issued a statement saying officials who had failed in their duties would face discipline. It pledged better responses to emergencies in the future.  Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that failing to halt the outbreak could erode social stability in the nation of more than 1. 4 billion people.  ""The outbreak is a major test of China's system and capacity for governance,"" Xi said, according to state media. ""We must sum up the experience and draw a lesson from it. "" More than 20,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed around the world, fewer than 300 of them outside mainland China. Eleven of them are in the U. S.  The death toll was at 492, all in mainland China except for one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. More than 2,000 hospital workers in Hong Kong went on strike for a second day Tuesday to demand that the border with mainland China be closed in response to the outbreak.  The total number of cases worldwide stands at 23,892. Based on the latest figures, the coronavirus fatality rate is 2. 1%, a figure that has been holding steady throughout the epidemic. Overall, that compares with a fatality rate of 9. 6% for SARS.  The virus has had the harshest impact among the elderly and those with other health problems. Jiao Yahui, a National Health Commission official in China, said more than 80% of those who have died were older than 60, and more than 75% had an underlying disease.  Sylvie Birand, director for global infections hazard preparedness at the World Health Organization, said it was ""very early"" in the outbreak. She declined to describe the outbreak as a pandemic and said it remained mostly contained in China.  ""Currently we are not in a pandemic,"" Birand said. ""We are at a phase where we have an epidemic of coronavirus with multiple foci and we try to extinguish each of these foci. ""  More than 3,500 quarantined on Princess ship: Guest tests positive for coronavirus The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that it does not recommend face masks to help prevent the virus, saying it is not spreading in communities in the U. S. Rather, the CDC urged precautions common for combating the flu, such as washing hands often and avoiding contact with people who are sick.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, on Tuesday reiterated his call to all countries not to impose restrictions that"" unnecessarily interfere"" with international travel and trade.  ""Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit,"" Tedros said. ""Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves. "" On Friday, the Trump administration declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency in the United States. U. S. citizens who have been in China's Hubei province and are returning to the U. S. will undergo health screenings and be monitored during mandatory quarantines of up to 14 days, officials said.  The U. S. also announced a suspension of entry into the United States of foreign nationals who pose a risk for the transmission of the virus. And multiple airlines have halted or curtailed China flights.  France, which has six confirmed cases of the virus and has evacuated hundreds of people citizens on two flights, on Tuesday joined Britain in warning against any non-essential travel to China and suggesting that all its citizens in China leave while the coronavirus is still spreading.

In the first weekend of 2020, seven Democratic presidential candidates blew through Iowa like a snow squall. Elizabeth Warren appeared in Manchester, Maquoketa, Davenport and Dubuque. Bernie Sanders also stopped by Dubuque, in addition to Grundy Center, Mason City and Boone. Joe Biden logged significant miles around the Hawkeye State as well, visiting Waterloo, Davenport, Grinnell, Vinton and Des Moines. 
I landed in the state capital at the same time as John Delaney's Sunday event in Sheldon and checked into my room while Biden was speaking in Davenport. If I had unpacked a little faster, I could have caught the tail end of Tom Steyer's talk in Newton. But after the flight, I just wanted a drink, without the politicking.
Over the next few weeks, all eyes will bore into Iowa, the first state in the country to hold caucuses or a primary. The Democratic candidates "" 12 at the time of publishing, 14 during my visit "" are blanketing the Midwestern state, jockeying for supporters before the Feb. 3 caucuses. (A few Republicans challenging President Trump, such as Bill Weld and Joe Walsh, are also popping up in Iowa.) The politically minded will focus on the policies, positions and personalities of the POTUS hopefuls, but I was more interested in the datelines "" the destinations and attractions that will be here long after the politicians have moved on to another state, another election. While the candidates come to Iowa for votes, I came to Iowa for Iowa.
For three out of every four years, Iowa is relegated to flyover status. So, you can't blame the state of corn, Hawkeyes and Herbert Hoover for basking in the spotlight while it can. 
As a D.C. resident, my ears have been rubbed raw by political talk. But in Iowa, the topic seemed refreshing and new. Like the time I spotted my college professor on a beach in Rhode Island. I found her more compelling in a different environment. 

Businesses around the state are capitalizing on this moment. Sock Spot, a vendor in the NewBo City Market in Cedar Rapids, carries election-themed sport socks with candidates' names (Mayor Pete [Buttigieg], Warren), public service announcements ('Do the right thing 2020') and unifying slogans ('I vote for snacks'). The store's owner, who was wearing chihuahua-print socks, said the Bernie Sanders and Trump styles with unruly hair (comb included, to tame the locks) were doing well. But if votes were based on sales, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes would become the next president.
Raygun, a printing, clothing and novelty retailer with several locations around the state, slaps a crooked smile on the straight face of such serious subjects as politics, social causes and Iowa stereotypes. The company, which leans left, has created islands of candidate-related merchandise within its stores. Here, you can pick up books by Warren, Sanders and Biden, among others; T-shirts ('Give Pete a chance!'); and laser-cut ornaments (Warren hanging with Lizzo and a gun-toting cat). If you have lost track of which candidates have dropped out of the race, check the discounted rack: The 'Iowa for Beto' shirts are on sale.

On weekends, diners, including many Drake University students nursing hangovers, stand in line for breakfast at Waveland Cafe in Des Moines. The place is packed; the clamoring for hash browns loud. But on a Monday morning, I had many seating choices: counter or booth, by the photo montage of regulars or the wall of signatures by journalists and politicians. Two bites into my rye toast, I noticed a familiar face with a Ned Flanders mustache and a Hawaiian shirt. I dropped my slice to say hello to Waveland owner David Stone. I asked him how the cafe had become a campaign and press stop during the caucuses. He said it gained national attention in 2000, when Tom Brokaw reported live from the 54-seat diner. This year, CNN wanted to set up operations inside, but Stone declined: feeding frenzy before media frenzy. 
'They can't take over the restaurant on a weekend,' he said. 'We are extremely busy, and I can't have cameras getting in the way of my customers.' 
Not even Aquaman could move the mountain of eggs and potatoes. When Jason Momoa, a native Iowan, wanted to hold a family reunion at the diner last year, Stone agreed, but only if his party arrived at 7 a.m. and cleaned their plates before the official opening hour of 8. 'He complied,' Stone said of the herculean actor. 

Since 2004, the Hamburg Inn No. 2 in Iowa City has held the Coffee Bean Caucus. The process is much easier than the actual Iowa caucuses. At the front counter, guests take a bean from a jar and drop it into a smaller container (a paper-clip holder?) embellished with the name of their preferred candidate. At the end of the day, the staff transfers the beans to the larger Mason jars lined up on a shelf near the front door. The policy is one person/one vote, but everyone can participate, including non-natives (often called 'captives' in Iowa-speak), children and foreigners.
'This gives us a really good sense of what the consensus in Iowa City is,' said Elise Prendergast, the front house manager, adding that Sanders won in 2016. 
On the Tuesday morning I stopped by, Buttigieg and Sanders were bean-to-bean, and Mike Bloomberg's canister was empty. However, Elise said the numbers are always in flux. After the December debate, Amy Klobuchar's bean count rose. 

The restaurant is lined with press clippings, and toward the back, you can genuflect before a shrine to past candidates and ex-presidents. In 1992, three years after leaving office, Ronald Reagan visited the Hamburg Inn and sat at what is now the Presidential Table. According to the menu from his visit, he ordered meatloaf, french fries, green beans, a roll with butter and apple pie a la mode, which he ate first. 
Of course, tastes and diets have changed since the Reagan years, so I asked Elise for her menu picks. She recommended the hamburgers and pie shakes, a blend of vanilla ice cream and pie "" America in a glass.
At Eatery A in Des Moines, I ordered a Moscow mule and chatted with the mustachioed bartender about the restaurant's former occupants, first a Blockbuster Video store and later Barack Obama's caucus headquarters. I had read that a few campaign offices were nearby "" Delaney's is a few blocks away "" and wondered whether he had a Spidey sense about the diners' identities. With the excitement of a wildlife enthusiast on safari, I asked him whether he could point to any campaign workers. 
'They wear buttons,' he answered, scanning the establishment.
We didn't see any lapel accessories, but he did notice a man and woman of distinction in the booth behind me.
'Are you guys with the Well Pennies?' he gushed to the Des Moines-based folk-pop band. 'I love your song, 'Ooh La La.' '
That night at the hotel, I fell asleep to the duo's music and not the news headlines. 

In Pella, a Dutch-accented town about an hour east of Des Moines, the woman in the white bonnet didn't want to talk politics. She had more pressing matters to discuss: pastries. 
Bakeries all over town post signs in their windows for Dutch letter cookies. However, the employee at Jaarsma Bakery explained that the S-shaped sweets are traditionally baked for Sinterklaasavond, or Dutch Santa Claus Day, on Dec. 6. For more seasonally correct snacking, she suggested an almond banket, which is similar to a letter cookie but with more almond paste and shaped like a flagpole.
Jaarsma Bakery opened in 1898, about 50 years after the Dutch immigrants arrived in Iowa seeking religious freedom. The Old World traditions still run deep. Since 1935, the town has held Tulip Time, a springtime festival celebrating the Netherlands' flower power. The Vermeer Windmill, the tallest working mill in North America, soars nearly 125 feet high, its 82-foot-long blades whirring like a lazy fan. Five times a day, the Klokkenspel stirs to life with chiming bells and lively characters. There's Dominie Hendrik Pieter Scholte, who led the 800 newcomers to the City of Refuge, and his wife, Maria, who is in tears after all but one of her good dishes shattered during the crossing. (She is also upset about her new digs, a log cabin.) Wyatt Earp earned a spot on the musical clock because the gunslinger grew up here. His childhood home is part the Historical Village, a collection of 22 buildings including the Werkplaats, where wooden shoes are made, and the Delft House, which contains vintage pieces of the famous pottery.

Continuing east, I left Pella's self-described 'Touch of Holland,' for the Willkommen mat of the Amana Colonies, a National Historic Landmark. Starting in 1855, German immigrants fleeing religious persecution (see Pella, with a Deutschland twist) established seven villages on 26,000 acres of land in central Iowa. They lived communally until the Great Change of 1932, when they split the shared nest for a more independent lifestyle. Today, about 1,600 people reside in the colonies, including 300 adherents of the Amana church, a breakaway sect of the Lutheran Church.
During the winter months, the historical buildings keep limited hours, but Jon M. Childers, executive director of the Amana Heritage Society, held the keys to the colonies. We visited the communal kitchen and the church in Middle Amana, and toured the exhibits at the heritage museum, which included the world's first microwave and (empty) buckets of lard and barrels of pickled German cut beans from the subsistence days. Jon drove me by the 163-year-old Amana Woolen Mill, Iowa's oldest and only working woolen mill, the site of a new boutique hotel that is scheduled to open in the fall. In between stops, he told me how as a Boy Scout, he provided 'security' for Ted Kennedy, who visited during his 1979-80 run for president. (The boys encircled the former Massachusetts senator.) More recently, Obama and Hillary Clinton spoke at the Festhalle Barn about a month apart in 2007; a year later, Bill Clinton stumped for his wife at the Amana RV Park. He also picked up a blanket from a shop Jon had set up in the registration office, for those chilly nights in Chappaqua, N.Y. I asked Jon what could politicians learn from the Amana colonists.
'Amana is inclusive,' he said. 'People sit and listen. It feels like a big family.' 
In the fantasy baseball movie 'Field of Dreams,' the voice said, 'If you build it, he will come.' Meanwhile, the voice in my head said: 'If you offer a house tour that doesn't involve standing outside in freezing cold, she will come.' Someone clearly heard me.
I recognized the two-story clapboard farmhouse in Dyersville from a corn field away. It sat above the baseball field, which looked smaller in person. I buzzed the doorbell and a guide ushered me inside. After putting on protective booties, I followed her through the kitchen, where a photo of Ray and Annie Kinsella, the fictional field-builders, sat on the counter. In the living room, the 1989 film played on a boxy TV, the sound off to prevent the tour guides from going mad. 
I learned all sorts of movie trivia, such as the actor who played the 'voice' remains a mystery (maybe Ray Liotta or Ed Harris, the husband of Amy 'Annie' Madigan?) and the corn grew so high, thanks to human intervention, that Kevin 'Ray' Costner had to stand on a 12-inch platform. I stared out the bay window, a renovation care of Universal Studios, but didn't see any ghost players emerge. Maybe they are waiting for Major League Baseball to finish building its regulation field adjacent to the FOD. On Aug. 13, the New York Yankees and White Sox will compete in Iowa's first regular-season game to a crowd of 8,000. On this January morning, I had zero fans to cheer me. But I did have the voice in my head reminding me that the sooner I rounded those bases, the quicker I could return to my heated car. 
Winter is prime time for viewing bald eagles in the Midwest. The birds of prey, which start arriving in September, hunt for food along Iowa's major rivers. I started my search for the country's emblem in the cafeteria of the National Mississippi River Museum - Aquarium in Dubuque. The restaurant overlooks Ice Harbor, a man-made offshoot of the Upper Mississippi. No luck on the birds, but even better, I found Jared McGovern, the museum's curator of conservation programs, eating a chicken sandwich. Jared told me to look by the lock-and-dam systems along the Mississippi River, where eagles often feast on the fish uprooted by the rushing water. Plan B: Check the fields, in the off chance a farmer tossed a dead pig. Like many Americans, eagles prefer fast food to a labor-intensive meal made from scratch.

I followed Jared's instructions, driving out to Lock and Dam No. 11 (nothing) and Eagle Point Park (maybe something) in Dubuque. Standing on the lip of the park above the Mississippi, I caught a glimpse of two dark-feathered birds (juveniles?) and a third with a white head (mom or dad?). I tried to snap a photo to send to Jared for confirmation but couldn't free my hand from my mitten in time. Back in the car, I continued south on the Great River Road National Scenic Byway to Bellevue (Lock and Dam No. 12 and Bellevue State Park), Green Island and Sabula, the state's only island city. In Davenport, seagulls circled Lock and Dam No. 13 and Canada geese pecked at the frozen banks.

The next day, I had moved on from the bald eagles; I now only cared about blankets. I had returned to Amana and was walking down the street when a mother exclaimed to her son, 'Bald eagle,' and pointed at the sky. The little boy and I both looked up and watched the bird soar toward the setting sun. Tinted in golden light, the bald eagle looked regal and proud, even if he was just going to freeload in a farmer's field.
I also spotted my button. A few hours before my flight back to Washington, I was drinking coffee at the Scenic Route Bakery in Des Moines when Jackson Boaz walked in wearing a 'Students for Warren' pin on his wool jacket. The 15-year-old high school freshman from Northern California started every morning at the cafe with a cup of oatmeal. Iowa in January, he said, was 'too cold for parfait.' The young campaign volunteer shared his impressions of the state with me.
'I love the energy here in Des Moines and in Iowa as a whole,' he said. 'They have this sacred role as the first in the country. It's like the political Super Bowl.' Anything else? 'The food has been pretty dang good.' 
Jackson was leaving in mid-January but hoped to return to Iowa for the caucuses "" and maybe the oatmeal, too.

Faith Trznadel was born without a tibia bone, and when she was 10-months old, doctors had to amputate her lower leg.
'The hardest part is the staring, the snickering,' said Faith's mother, Sheila Trznadel, about how other people treated her daughter. 'One message to get across to people is it's okay to ask questions. . . . It's better to ask questions than just stare. [It's] getting rid of that stigma.'
When Faith first started walking, she was fitted for a prosthetic. As a growing child, she needed a new leg every eight to 12 months. Insurance covered most of the $30,000 cost for each new prosthetic, but the family was still left with thousands of dollars in medical bills. Because of their medical plan, the total cost depended on their other medical expenses for the year.
When Faith was 5, her family realized her prosthetic was fine for walking, but not running. The walking prosthetic covered by insurance wasn't designed for fast movement. It lacked an ankle joint, for example, and limited the speed at which Faith could move. So her family tried to get her a prosthetic that would let Faith run. 
'Our insurance declared that it was not medically necessary to run,' said Trznadel, who is covered by BlueCross BlueShield, 'so she couldn't have a running leg.'
 At first Faith wanted to play tag and other games, and then as she grew up, she wanted to join athletic teams. Without a specialized and more expensive prosthetic, she would be relegated to the sidelines.
Thousands of children are born with limb differences in the United States every year, and many do not have access to affordable prosthetics. Prosthetic limbs can cost from $5,000 to over $50,000, and many insurance carriers restrict financial coverage, placing limits on how much they will pay. 
 Adult prosthetics may last a few years, but children who need prosthetics can grow out of them as fast as they outgrow their clothes, creating a critical need for affordable, sustainable limbs.
 'The amount covered may vary depending on the type of coverage the member has and the benefits allowed under that coverage,' CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield said in a statement. 'Typically we provide coverage for prosthetics that are medically necessary to replace an absent or nonfunctioning body part. Repairs, adjustments and replacements due to growth or reasonable weight loss or gain, and normal wear and tear are typically considered medically necessary.'
 The nonprofit sector is trying to help fill the gap in affordable prosthetic limbs in innovative ways, as well as creating communities where children can excel. For example, summer camps bring children together and provide athletic training and encouragement. Entrepreneurs are engineering ways to work with recycled plastics and new technologies.
Faith, who lives outside Chicago, is now 11 and loves dancing and gymnastics, activities she is able to pursue because of Amputee Blade Runners. The Nashville-based nonprofit group, which relies on corporate and individual sponsors and foundations for funding, provided her with a running prosthetic. 
 Joshua Southards, executive director of ABR, said that because most Americans in need of prosthetics are elderly, children are often overlooked. ABR works with children to provide what they need to take part in athletics, such as racing each other on playgrounds and competing in tournaments.
 Sheila Trznadel is the former executive director of the NubAbility Athletics Foundation, which hosts camps for children with limb differences. NubAbility pairs children with counselors who look like they do, to build their confidence on and off the sports field. The foundation hosts several camps a year, in different locations. 
This year, there are two "" one in Florida focused on baseball skills and one in Idaho that will feature snow sports.
'Kids come into our camp, and they'll be hiding their hand or putting it in their pocket, and then realizing . . . there's nothing wrong with me. They walk out with their heads held high,' Trznadel said.
At camp last summer, Faith met Abbey McPherren. 'They just clicked,' Trznadel said. 'They both did dance, cheer and gymnastics camp together.' 
Abbey is a cheerful 11-year-old with dozens of gymnastics medals. She was born with symbrachydactyly, a limb difference on her left hand. One child out of 32,000 births has this congenital condition, characterized by missing, shorter or conjoined fingers.
'I think people tend to be careful with kids who maybe only have one leg or only have one hand. . . . [Abbey] has taught me a lot about bravery and being courageous,' said Abbey's mother, Melissa McPherren. 'There's no limit you can put on any kid, with any limb difference or any difference.'
Abbey has a purple and green prosthetic hand, custom-made with recycled ocean plastic by the Million Waves Project. Abbey, who lives with her family outside Seattle, is one of the project's young spokespersons.
'We're big ocean people,' Melissa McPherren said. Becoming involved with Million Waves has sparked a passion for ocean conservation in Abbey. 'Now when she sees plastic or anything at the beach, she's like, 'Oh, my gosh, we've got to pick that up, Mom.' '
The Million Waves Project creates prosthetic hands for children using plastic water bottles collected from the seas to address two critical needs: providing affordable prosthetic hands and cleaning up ocean plastic pollution. 
Every year, 10 to 24 billion pounds of plastic end up in the ocean, adding to the billions of pounds already plaguing our waterways and sea life. The Million Waves Project uses plastic water bottles from beaches and from donations, shreds them and makes them usable for 3-D printers. It takes about 30 water bottles to make a hand, said Chris Moriarity, who started Million Waves with his wife, Laura Moriarity, as a project in their dining room in coastal Northwest Washington state. 
Million Waves partnered with a self-described, 'digital humanitarian' organization called e-Nable to crowdsource their 3-D printers, working with hundreds of volunteers all over the world who own personal 3-D printers to create custom-fit, eco-friendly prosthetic hands. The hands are provided at no cost to the recipients.
Million Waves and e-Nable match children with makers in their area. The owner of the printer and the family organize fittings and print the custom hand. Kids can even request a 'Frozen'-themed Elsa hand or an 'Iron Man' arm. 
All of the design files are open-source and available through e-Nable.
Jen Owen is the founder of enablingthefuture.org, an online community, and the co-founder of e-Nable. In 2011, excited about their handmade steampunk science-fiction costumes, Jen and her then husband, Ivan, posted a YouTube video showing Ivan using a giant, working mechanical hand. From there, an open-source platform to share engineering ideas was born.
Owen now estimates that their network has grown to 20,000 people in 100 countries. They have made more than 5,000 hands. Owen said it is difficult to find the exact numbers because the designs and materials are all crowdsourced and open-access. People 'really have no idea the impact their creativity could have on the world unless they share it,' said Owen.
Abbey and Faith have been inspired by Shaquem Griffin, a linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, who is also limb different. Abbey was encouraged by a video showing him weightlifting with his prosthetic hand.
Sheila Trznadel said the biggest challenge was making sure the children with limb differences had community, 'knowing they're not alone, knowing that they can do anything.'

Big alcohol brands are following, not leading. And where they are headed is alternative drink categories, many of them 'hard' versions of nonalcoholic beverages.
Hard seltzer surpassed $500-million in sales in 2019, according to consumer research firm Nielsen, growing more than 200 percent in 2019. It took a bite out of light beer sales and contributed to a decline in the volume of wine purchases in the United States, the first drop since 1994. For the Super Bowl, Bud Light debuted Bud Light Seltzer commercials, a 5 percent alcohol beverage offered in four fruity flavors. California wine giant Barefoot has made the biggest investment in its 55-year history to launch four white wine-based seltzers in the first quarter of this year.
While beer sales slumped 4.6-percent between October 2018 and October 2019, according to Nielsen, the winners have been in low-alcohol near-beer; 'hard' kombucha, coffee and tea; mocktails and other low- and no-alcohol beverage categories. 
 The nonalcoholic beverage market is forecast to reach $1252.54 billion by 2024 with an annual growth rate of nearly 5-percent.
Ross Colbert, managing director and global head for beverages for KPMG Corporate Finance, says that big beverage companies have been slow to realize that millennials don't trust big brands to manufacture authentic, transparent, sustainable products, particularly in beverage categories.
'Big brands did not recognize these behaviors,' Colbert said, 'and it enabled a whole ecosystem of craft brand owners to emerge. It wasn't until those artisan players started nibbling at the heels of the leaders that they said: 'We have a big problem.' '
Big food and beverage companies have started to get it right, he said, acquiring more authentic brands and products, supplementing their research and development teams and adding on venture capital-like capabilities to build up their ability to screen, evaluate and invest in smaller, faster-growing craft brands and businesses.
'They are playing catch-up, and it's working,' he said. 'Big brands are starting to get back on their front foot to deliver what a consumer is looking for.'
And what they are looking for is something that didn't exist just a few years ago. They are mash-ups, beverages that cross categories and boundaries, even blurring distinctions between energy drinks, recovery drinks, boozy beverages and those with 'functional' benefits and health halos.
While these hard versions made their entry into the alcohol-based beverages market fairly recently, LatentView Analytics, a digital analytics firm, concluded that hard versions of health drinks such as alcohol-infused kombucha are here to stay.
'Consumers seem to prefer these beverages because they are organic [which] helps them believe that it is still part of a 'healthy lifestyle,' a term that is not ordinarily associated with alcohol consumption,' said LatentView's Midwest director Shalabh Shalabh.
Some of these new mash-ups represent collaborations between brands. 
In September, MillerCoors teamed up with ready-to-drink cult coffee favorite La Colombe to debut La Colombe Hard Cold Brew Coffee. It doesn't always work seamlessly, said Caleb Bryant, associate director of food and drink reports for market research firm Mintel, pointing to Pabst Blue Ribbon, which in July launched an 8 percent hard-coffee version of its signature beer, which experts like Bryant say might confuse the brand's identity: PBR experienced a dramatic renaissance between 2005 and 2010 for appealing to hipsters with its 'retro chic.'
The hard seltzers, he says, are unusual because they appeal to all ages and genders.
'You don't see that anymore, products that have near universal appeal,' Bryant said. 
He says that a third of Generation Z spirits drinkers say they have taken an extended break from alcohol in the past six months and that underage drinking has fallen dramatically from previous generations. But there's another demographic change that may account for a shift away from higher-alcohol beverages: an aging population. Generally speaking, alcohol consumption and binge drinking decreases with age.
All this temperateness flies in the face of some recent data, however. A study last month from the National Center for Health Statistics indicates deaths from alcohol-related problems have more than doubled over the past nearly 20 years. There were 73,000 deaths in the United States in 2017 because of liver disease and other alcohol-related illnesses, up from 36,000 deaths in 1999.
Jenny Zegler, associate director of food and drink for Mintel, may have an answer to this apparent paradox. It's not about drinking less, just smarter, she said.
'For the longest time, we really only had nonalcoholic beer to fulfill the need for moderation. You had to explain to your friends and endure the stigma that might come with it,' she said. 'With these hard seltzers, it's not moderation in the 'I'm not going to be drinking alcohol' sense, but more in the 'I'm going to be drinking for a long time and I don't want to be out of control' sense. Hard seltzer has good positioning because you can drink it all day long and you aren't going to get bloated or drunk.'
With more niche categories such as kombucha, she said consumers are trying a hard version of a beverage or flavor they already enjoy. She said that from a corporate standpoint, offering lower-alcohol versions of existing boozy categories and modestly boozy versions of nonalcoholic categories is a way to keep consumers engaged.
What will we see next?
Colbert said to look for these mash-up categories with CBD added into the mix and that even faddish categories such as alt-milks are eligible. Will we see hard oat milk?
'With the right blending, could there be a White Russian or Baileys from a plant-based recipe?' Colbert speculated. 'Absolutely.'

Over the past several decades, women have marched into male-dominated industries such as medicine, law and finance. Men, meanwhile, have been less willing to enter occupations dominated by women "" fields such as nursing and education "" even as those jobs have been growing much faster.
But a new study found that one particular 'shock' factor "" the loss of a job "" could explain why some men are willing to take jobs in occupations traditionally dominated by women.
Men who worked in male-dominated occupations and became unemployed were more likely to take jobs in female-dominated industries than men who changed jobs without a gap in their employment, the researchers found.
'One of the biggest takeaways is that economic conditions really matter for whether men go into female-dominated jobs,' said Jill Yavorsky, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who co-wrote the study. Unemployment, she said, 'may act as a trigger event that encourages them to consider new alternatives.'
The latest jobs report showed that women outnumbered men among payroll jobs for only the second time, boosted by higher job growth in traditionally female fields such as health care and education. (The figures do not include self-employed workers or farmworkers "" men still outnumber women in the total workforce.) Those industries are growing faster than fields dominated by men, such as manufacturing and goods production.
Christine Williams, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin who has researched what happens when men enter professions dominated by women, said she liked the authors' description of unemployment as a 'shock.' 'You have to be somehow taken out of your routine. If you're just sitting there talking to a guidance counselor, it may not jump out at you that you want to work in health care, but we're in an economy right now where [not everyone] has a lot of options.'
The study, published in the January issue of the journal Social Science Research, examined eight years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation. It found that among the men who worked in male-dominated industries or those with mixed-gender workforces "" and then became unemployed "" 19 percent chose to go into female-dominated occupations. Among men who did not experience a job loss, just 12 percent made a similar move.
The study also found that men who went into female-dominated jobs not only became employed again "" they also experienced, on average, a 4 percent wage increase and a boost in the 'prestige' rating of their occupation, compared with the one they had before they lost their jobs.
Yavorsky cited a couple of possible explanations. One may be that men are willing to take positions stigmatized as 'pink-collar' jobs only if they are compensated more highly through pay or status. The other could be that some of the men in the sample who became unemployed were in jobs that paid even less than those dominated by women.
The growth in female-dominated occupations has largely been at the bottom and the top of the wage scale "" with jobs such as home health aides on the low end and nurse practitioners on the high end, Yavorsky said. Meanwhile, jobs that have long offered women a path to the middle class are getting hollowed out, with more than 2.1 million administrative support and office support jobs shed since 2000.
Mike Ward, who recently finished a master's program to become a nurse practitioner after 11 years as an emergency room and intensive care unit nurse, decided to go into nursing after being laid off as an oil field roughneck in 2000, working for a drilling company in the Gulf of Mexico. He bounced around for several years, fueling airplanes, working in a paper mill and doing jobs for an electrical company before finally qualifying for financial aid and getting into school in 2003.
He had long had an interest in medicine "" but he said he had to look past stigmas associated with men going into nursing. 'I was going from job to job [where] there was an income ceiling I couldn't break through,' said Ward, 43, who is based in Fort Worth and now makes six figures and serves as vice president of the American Association for Men in Nursing. 'My closest friends "" they poked at me a little bit, but they're not laughing anymore.'
Yavorsky is careful to note that 'unemployment is not a viable strategy for getting more men to go into female-dominated jobs.' But she said employers may want to rethink how they pay jobs traditionally considered feminine or masculine, such as human resources and finance.
Indeed, a big recession with widespread unemployment happened not that long ago "" but had a relatively minor effect on gender-based job segregation, notes Betsey Stevenson, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan who was also an economic adviser in the Obama administration.
'Think about how big the unemployment shock was in 2008, and we didn't see a big realignment,' Stevenson said. Shifting the gender balance of different jobs will take more of a societal shift, she said.
'I think one of the challenges for men is we need to see more cultural images that reshape our notions of traditionally female jobs as actually being jobs that are more gender-neutral and more consistent with masculinity,' she said.

Schools and hospitals
are taking precautions 
to thwart coronavirus
Amid the rapidly changing global health threat of coronavirus, Washington-area hospitals, schools and government agencies say they are relying on time-tested strategies for infectious disease control: Wash your hands, cover your cough, and stay home if you're sick.
It may not sound exciting. But experts say the boring mainstays of public health and practicing good hygiene are the best defenses, for now, against the respiratory disease formally known as covid-19. They note the practices also are the best way to thwart a particularly virulent strain of the flu circulating this winter.
No cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the District, Maryland or Virginia. Yet elected officials and experts are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for the possibility of a widespread epidemic, while working overtime to quell panic.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Thursday that he will request an additional $10 million for emergency preparations. ""While we are hoping for the best, we are also actively planning for the worst,"" he said from the state's emergency management headquarters in Reisterstown.
Three Maryland residents are being tested for the virus, the Maryland Department of Health said Friday. In Virginia, eight residents have tested negative for coronavirus. As of Friday, the state health department had monitored 279 individuals, up from 179 on Thursday.

D.C. officials said Friday that five residents had tested negative for the virus, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's office on Thursday issued a reminder that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups.
""Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem,"" the statement said.

Many school districts in the region have sent lengthy emails to parents saying they have canceled trips to countries where residents have fallen ill from the coronavirus and suspended exchange programs with some countries, including South Korea, Japan and Italy. 
In an email to parents, Prince George's County Public Schools gave detailed instructions on precautions, including advising people ""to wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer."" 
Reports Wednesday night that California had discovered its first case of a person contracting the disease with no link to foreign travel amplified the perceived threat for many Americans and helped topple U.S. financial markets. 
""We all need to remain calm and put this into perspective,"" said Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at the Johns Hopkins Health System. ""While there is a fear of the unknown, one of the things that helps the most is to take concrete steps to prepare."" 
She said that for all types of emergencies, there is a therapeutic benefit to having necessary medicines on hand and identifying a family meeting place.
While the flu tends to dissipate after the spring, she said, there's no way to predict a pattern with coronavirus. 

""We do see seasonality for certain infections - influenza reliably comes between October and late April or May,"" she said. ""With a new virus, we just don't know how it will behave.""

Experts at hospitals in the Washington region said the California report was concerning and spurred additional discussions but did not change protocols that have been in place for some time. Patients who walk into medical centers and major hospitals for any reason are asked questions to determine whether they could have the virus: Have they traveled internationally recently? Do they have symptoms of a cold? 
If patients answer ""yes"" to both questions, they will be asked to wear a mask and placed in a private room, while providers ask detailed questions about which countries they visited, why and for how long. 
The CDC on Thursday expanded its geographical area of concern, initially limited to Wuhan in China, to China, Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.
The local public health department then decides whether the person should be investigated for possible infection; if so, the agency arranges testing through the CDC. Currently, Maryland and Virginia labs do not have the capability to test for covid-19.
The initial procedures are not unlike protocols practiced by hospitals every flu season, said Kari Scantlebury, an emergency medicine doctor and lead physician adviser for emergency management for Inova Health System.
""This is the bread and butter of emergency medicine,"" said Scantlebury, who added that she and her colleagues are closely monitoring CDC guidance. ""This is what we do for a living.""
Glenn W. Wortmann, director of infectious diseases at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said the situation is constantly in flux. 
He is hoping more data will be released regarding the California case, but he said it's inevitable that the virus will spread within the United States: ""I'd like to think it won't happen, but I think we need to be prepared for it happening."" 
Wortmann said most people experience coronavirus as a bad cold, and about 15 percent require hospitalization. The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions tend to fare the worst.
""This is a new virus,"" he said. ""Although it's scary, the data out of China show most people who get infected do well.""
The Virginia Department of Public Health on Thursday took the rare step of sending a letter to 150,000 doctors, nurses and other clinicians about the public health threat. 
It provided an overview of the outbreak starting from Jan. 30, when the World Health Organization declared a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and asked for volunteers to register with the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps.


""For the general public right now, the risk of covid-19 is very low,"" Lilian Peake, director of the Virginia Office of Epidemiology, said in an interview. ""But it is a time for us to be thinking about what could happen and using this time to prepare. Better to be prepared and to be wrong than to not be prepared.""
First responders are taking the same measured approach. 
Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service distributed kits - including masks for patients, masks for responders, cleansing wipes and protective face shields - to 50 transport units and stocked up on supplies in case of a future shortage. 
""We treat it just like an infectious disease, so we like to think we're prepared already,"" Fire and Rescue spokesman Pete Piringer said. 
Public health officials said they are applying lessons learned through treatment of the seasonal flu, but also H1N1, SARS, Ebola, Zika, West Nile and even chikungunya.
""This isn't the first time we're seeing it,"" Scantlebury, of Inova, said. ""It isn't going to be the last time.""

Aging Well: Solutions to the Most Pressing Global Challenges of Aging

Jean Galiana and William Haseltine
What makes for good aging?
For many older people, it isn't just the absence of health problems "" it's the presence of meaning and connection. Social inclusion, which improves people's ability to take part in society, helps create sustaining ties for older adults, reducing health-care costs and cutting the physical and mental toll of loneliness.
'Aging Well: Solutions to the Most Pressing Global Challenges of Aging,' a new guide by Jean Galiana and William Haseltine, lays out powerful reasons to consider social inclusion in everything from urban planning to hospice care. Haseltine, a scientist and philanthropist, is the chair and president of ACCESS Health International, a New York-based think tank devoted to accessible health care. The book looks at effective eldercare policies and practices around the world and points to ways to help people age well.
Most of the recommendations are straightforward, such as making long-term care insurance more accessible and coordinate primary care. But the recommendations don't just have to do with costs or care facilities. Instead, words like 'purpose' and 'resilience' echo throughout the guide.
The authors point out several tactics that can help older people find purpose and connections in their lives. 
One of them is cohousing, in which people share common spaces and neighborly support. Another, intergenerational learning, engages older people with younger students in universities, schools and care facilities. Even parks can help with social inclusion "" outdoor seating encourages generational interaction while giving the elderly a safe place to enjoy their neighborhoods.
Social inclusion helps combat loneliness, a condition long linked to poor health. 
A 2017 study funded by AARP found that older people who lack social contacts had higher death rates and spent more on health care than their more connected counterparts. Social isolation was associated with an estimated $6.7 billion in additional federal spending.
The authors say spaces and communities that include aging people fill 'many psychological and social needs of older adults.' They call such communities 'a powerful antidote to the pervasive systemic ageist stereotypes and prejudices seen around the world,' and a chance for people to continue lives filled with meaning, learning and relationships as they age.

Aging members of a small United Methodist church in the suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul are worried about where their funerals will be held after the church shuts its doors in June. The church plans to reopen after several months, but the traditional hymns could be missing, and there will be a new pastor, almost three decades younger than his predecessor.
One 70-year-old member called the church leaders' decision to fold temporarily to start a new congregation 'age discrimination.'
The situation at the Grove United Methodist Church has put the spotlight on widespread generational challenges across the country, with many leaders trying to attract younger people without alienating the seniors who are often the backbone of their dwindling congregations.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press recently suggested in a headline that the Cottage Grove church will 'usher out gray-haired members in effort to attract more young parishioners.' But the Rev. Dan Wetterstrom, its head pastor, said allegations of age discrimination unfairly represented the strategy for a church that has been on the decline for two decades.
'No one is being asked to leave the church,' said Wetterstrom, 59. 'People are disappointed that the service is being canceled.'
Church leaders voted to temporarily shutter the facility, and then reopen it after what they call a 'replanting.' Leaders said Tuesday they never asked members to leave, but they did say the church will relaunch with some changes to its look and feel.
There will be a new pastor, Jeremy Peters, 32. The music will be different from the traditional choir and hymnals the church has been using "" although it remains unclear what exactly will replace it.
Members who did not join the new church's planting team are being encouraged to step aside and temporarily attend the church's separate Woodbury location, which attracts about 400 worshipers on a weekly basis and is about a 15-minute drive from the Cottage Grove location. They would transition back to the remade church after 15 to 18 months.
'It felt like they were targeting us even though they didn't put an age number on it,' said William Gackstetter, 70, who lives about four blocks from the church.
The church's building sits on prime real estate because it's across the street from an Aldi and down the street from Target, he said. He is worried the church will be shut down permanently and turned into apartments, like other shuttered churches across the country.
Methodist leaders said the strategy is part of a relaunch effort that has been successful in other parts of the region, said Bruce Ough, who is the Methodist bishop of the Dakotas-Minnesota region and provides oversight to congregations. Minnesota has had a steep decline in worship attendance, but the state saw some modest growth starting in 2018, he said.
'This is about trying to live into what people all the time criticize us for not doing: make the church relevant and find innovative ways to reach the persons who claim to be spiritual but not religious because the settings they walk to that are religious don't awaken their spirit,' Ough said.
He said for many communities with younger populations or different ethnicities, leaders might need to adjust long-standing traditions.
'We haven't rejected anyone because of age,' he said. 'What I do encounter from time to time is people who turn it into ageism because even though they say they want to reach young people, they're reluctant to make changes that are necessary.'
Even the United Methodist Church, the largest mainline Protestant denomination in the country, is not immune to the declining membership numbers affecting other churches across the country in recent decades. The Pew Research Center in 2014 found that nearly 4-percent of Americans identify with the Methodist wing of Protestant churches. Baby boomers make up 38 percent of the denomination, compared with 13 percent of millennials.
The Cottage Grove-based church, which began in an elementary school in 1989, averaged 29 weekly worshipers in 2019.
Efforts to revitalize the existing congregation have not worked, said Wetterstrom, who oversees the Cottage Grove and Woodbury locations.
The decision to temporarily shut the doors at the Cottage Grove location was not because the church was financially struggling, Wetterstrom said. Cottage Grove is one of the faster-growing areas in the state, he said, and Minnesota's Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church decided to pour in $250,000 to shut that location and replant the congregation. Peters, the new pastor, will meet with members of the community and invite them to small group gatherings before starting services again in the fall. (The church is already part of the liberal wing of the larger United Methodist Church and is not part of a nationwide denominational split over same-sex marriage.)
It can be challenging for pastors to convince older parishioners that taking more dramatic measures to close the generation gap is valuable, said the Rev. Jason Byassee, a professor at the Vancouver School of Theology who has served as a Methodist pastor in North Carolina. 'The attitude can be, 'We give the money, don't change a thing,' ' he said. 'That's not church, that's a club.'
But congregations are growing older as younger people are less likely to identify as religious. In 1998, 29 percent of the average congregation was over 60 years old, said Mark Chaves, a sociologist at Duke University who studies congregations in America. In 2012, that percentage was 37-percent, and he said recent data suggests the percentage has continued to climb.
Churches have tried to solve a larger problem of decline by merging congregations, but it rarely works, Chaves said. About 1-percent of churches in the United States close every year.
'Organizations of all sorts have a kind of inertia, and it can be difficult to make changes,' he said. 'So it's easier to start another one than try to modify an existing one.'
Gackstetter's daughter Stella Knapp, 34, who sometimes attends the church with her family, said members were afraid of where their funerals might be held during the transition and feared that the temporary closure was not accommodating to the congregation of mostly elderly people.
'There's a lady who walks to church with a walker with oxygen,' Knapp said. 'How is she going to get to the Woodbury campus?'
Knapp gave The Washington Post notes from a Dec. 12 meeting in which Wetterstrom wrote that members were asked to be 'silent partners in the Planting Project through prayer, community expertise and support services.' The notes do not suggest elderly members were specifically targeted in those remarks, or that members were asked to 'reapply' to return to Cottage Grove, as the Pioneer Press wrote.

2020 nominees of the major categories include few people of color
It's Oscars season. And, once again, critics are pointing out the lack of racial diversity among the nominees. 
Although the conversation about representation during awards season has become more prominent in recent years, artists have long called out the Academy Awards for doing a poor job of recognizing the work of people who aren't white.
Only one black actor received a nomination this year: Cynthia Erivo for best actress for 'Harriet' (she also received a nod for best song).
'It's not enough that I'm the only one. It just isn't,' she told the New York Times last week, noting 'far too much work was done this year by incredible women and men of color that should be celebrated.' 
Her words echoed Eddie Murphy's from the 1988 Oscars ceremony. Before presenting the winner for best picture, Murphy told the audience that he initially declined the invitation from the academy, and reenacted the conversation he had with his manager about it: '-'I'm not going [to the Oscars] because they haven't recognized black people in motion pictures.' He said, 'What are you talking about? Black people win Oscars!' I said, 'Well, black actors and actresses have won Oscars throughout 60 years "" it was like Hattie McDaniel won the first one, then Sidney Poitier won one and Louis Gossett [Jr.],' ' Murphy said. (McDaniel won in 1940, Poitier in 1964 and Gossett in 1983.)
Murphy continued: 'I'll probably never win an Oscar for saying this but, hey, what the hey, I gotta say it. Actually, I might not be in any trouble because the way it's been going, every 20 years we get one, so we ain't due [till] about 2004 "" so by then, this will have all blown over.' 
His manager insisted he couldn't 'snub the academy,' so Murphy agreed to present the award, but added: 'I just want you to know that I'm gonna give this award, but black people will not ride the caboose of society, and we will not bring up the rear anymore. I want you to recognize us.' (Murphy would go on to receive a supporting actor Oscar nomination 19 years later for 'Dreamgirls,' but, as predicted, he has yet to win an Oscar).
Halle Berry won best actress in 2002 for 'Monster's Ball,' the first black woman to win in that category. While weeping onstage, she acknowledged her peers as well as the black women who had been nominated before her: 'This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.' 
Fifteen years later, Berry said 'that moment really meant nothing. It meant nothing. I thought it meant something, but I think it meant nothing.' No black woman has won best actress since.
Critics have often pointed out that when black actors do get nominated, it's usually for stereotypical roles such as servants, slaves or criminals. (As rapper Jadakiss put it, 'Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?,' referring to the actor's Oscar win for playing a corrupt cop in 'Training Day.')
When Kim Basinger introduced a best picture nominee in 1990, she first highlighted a glaring omission: Spike Lee's scorching drama about racism and police brutality. 'We've got five great films here, and they're great, for one reason: because they tell the truth. But there is one film that's missing from this list, that deserves to be on it because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all, and that's 'Do the Right Thing.' '
'Driving Miss Daisy' won best picture that year. In it, Morgan Freeman played a black chauffeur to a wealthy, white, elderly woman; he'd later call the role 'a mistake,' leading him to be typecast in 'wise, old, dignified, black man' roles. (Lee wouldn't be nominated for best picture until 2019, when his 'BlacKkKlansman' lost to 'Green Book,' a divisive film about a poor, uneducated white man who chauffeurs a rich, acclaimed, black musician through the segregated South. 'Every time someone is driving somebody, I lose,' Lee said in the press room of the awards show.)
The conversation really kicked into high gear starting in 2015 when April Reign's #Oscars SoWhite tweet went viral. Mainstream media increasingly covered the glaring lack of diversity among nominees, drawing particular attention to the racial and ethnic makeup of the academy's voting body.
In 2016, only one nominee in the major acting and directing categories was not white. In the wake of the controversy, the academy announced major changes to its membership. Since then, the share of voting members who are people of color has doubled "" to 16-percent. 
Chris Rock tackled the #Oscars SoWhite controversy head-on when he hosted the 2016 ceremony. He also told a joke based on stereotypes of Asian kids being good at math; the academy later apologized for anything 'offensive' on the telecast.
But later during the broadcast, comedian Kevin Hart took to the stage to introduce a musical performance and said, 'I want to take a moment to applaud all of my actors and actresses of color that didn't get nominated tonight.'
'Tonight should not determine the hard work and effort you put into your craft. At the end of the day, we love what we do and we're breaking major ground doing it,' he said. 'These problems of today eventually will become problems of the old. Let's not let this negative issue of diversity beat us. Let's continue to do what we do best, and work hard.' 
Four years later, and those remarks are still relevant. Awkwafina won the Golden Globe for lead actress in a comedy for 'The Farewell,' but the Lulu Wang film about a family returning to China to say goodbye to their beloved matriarch was shut out by the Oscars. 'Parasite,' the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, received six Oscar nominations but not a single acting nod (a troubling trend regarding movies with predominantly Asian casts). Lupita Nyong'o, who won a supporting actress Oscar for '12 Years a Slave' in 2014, was overlooked for her work in Jordan Peele's 'Us,' as was Jennifer Lopez for her acclaimed turn in 'Hust lers.' 
That's plenty to inspire any presenter who wants to continue the long tradition of calling out the Oscars "" at the Oscars.

Thomas Cole, a gerontologist and professor of medical humanities, had two hip replacements, two back surgeries and a bad case of pneumonia in his 60s. He became depressed and wondered what the future held.
""I wanted to know what was ahead of me,"" says Dr. Cole, right, co-editor of ""The Oxford Book on Aging"" and author of ""The Journey of Life: A Cultural History of Aging in America."" For guidance, he turned to 12 men, all high-profile and in their 80s or older—a period some call the Fourth Age, considered the last of four stages of adulthood. He wanted to learn how they dealt with decline and whether they could find meaning in life even as it was nearing its end.
In his new book ""Old Man Country: My Search for Meaning Among the Elders,"" Dr. Cole, now 70, found that some issues that consumed him were no longer important to many of the older men, and that they generally weren't afraid of dying—but were afraid of dementia.
In an edited interview, Dr. Cole talks about his conversations with these men and why their perspectives matter, as the percentage of people aged 85 and older in the U.S. grows quickly.
You selected highly accomplished people like Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve, Ram Dass, a teacher of Eastern spirituality—both of whom have since died—and journalist Hugh Downs. Why not a broader cross-section of people?
I picked these people because I admired them and wanted to hear what they had to say. I also had a hunch they were just as fragile as anyone else. They all faced the same questions all men do: Am I still a man? Do I still matter? Am I loved? What is the meaning of my life? We ask those questions throughout life but they become more pressing because the finish line is in sight.
How do they reconcile manhood with declining physical abilities?
The issue of manhood seems to evaporate more than I would have thought. In the Third Age [65-80], men continue to try really hard to maintain their middle-age strength and potency. In the Fourth Age, for the most part, they are no longer interested in manhood as a defining category. If their capacity for sexual intercourse was gone, so be it. They have other ways to keep their relationships strong. There's no sense of failure.
Were there any exceptions to this?
One refused to say he was old. He was in his early 80s and going to the gym. He married a woman 20 years younger. He died a couple years ago from cancer. I wondered how he would have adapted to becoming frail. People do adapt even if they are terrified. At a certain point, you stop trying to hold onto what is gone. You embrace what is. Hugh Downs said he exercises every day to maintain his muscle strength, but accepts the biological process of old age.
What about fear of death?
It was common to hear: ""I don't want to die, but I'm not afraid of dying. I'm ready."" I was heartened because I think fear of death is a problem for all of us. The possibility of that fear dissipating as we get older is a testimony to the importance of a well-lived life. They would say, ""I've had a good life. In some way, I've left the world a better place. I'm loved.""
Do you think men and women age differently?
I can't speak with any authority on this, but I think many stereotypes are valid. Women are more connected to friends and family. They've been caregivers and can let themselves be cared for. Men, especially in that generation, live for work. They're often disconnected from their feelings and don't want to accept the need for care. But those traditional gender scripts aren't as rigid when people get to be in their 80s. Men do take up more house chores. They are better at caregiving and express more emotions.
Where do they find meaning in their old age?
From loving and being loved. Their world and aspirations shrink a little bit. Therefore love takes on larger meaning. Paul Volcker, who was still working, found meaning in being involved in things and feeling needed.
You've written about aging for more than 40 years. How have your own views on aging changed?
I've become more compassionate towards others and to my own body. In the past, when I saw an old man or old woman on a walker, or using a cane, I used to avoid them. Now I look at a person like that and think ""OK. That could be and will be me."" I feel solidarity rather than fear. Of course, frailty is not something I hope for or look forward to.
How have our attitudes as a society changed?
Not enough. We have ideals for the ""young old,"" these useful aging people who go to classes and exercise, travel and volunteer. It's fine to aspire to that. But we still fear the other half of that equation—the ""old old."" We don't take seriously the importance of lives of people who are frail and dying and suffering dementia.
Do you feel more reassured or more concerned about entering the Fourth Age?
I'm less afraid. I know that many of these changes are inevitable and I will have to face them, and that's a scary thing. At the same time I'm reassured because I see how old men do face them and how they continue to flourish. It's mostly because they have good and positive answers to these questions: Am I loved? What's the meaning of my life? Am I still relevant? Am I still a man?
