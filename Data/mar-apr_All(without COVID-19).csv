| Jump to first hitLOUISVILLE, Ky. – As the worldwide spread of COVID-19 has spiraled into a pandemic, national health organizations are warning that some members of the LGBTQ community may be “particularly vulnerable” to the effects of the virus.  While LGBTQ individuals have not been found to be more susceptible to contracting COVID-19, some health habits within the community, including significantly higher rates of smoking than the general population, have raised concern among health professionals.  Over 100 different national organizations, including Whitman-Walker Health and SAGE, have signed a letter created by the LGBT Cancer Network to bring attention to several factors that could mean the LGBTQ community is at a greater risk of complications from COVID-19, including: LGBTQ people smoke at rates 50% higher than the general population, which could be detrimental if a respiratory illness like COVID-19 is contracted.  Higher rates of HIV and cancer in the LGBTQ community means that a greater number of people may have compromised immune systems, which leaves them more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections.  Health care discrimination in America, including denial of care, unwelcoming attitudes and lack of understanding from staff and providers means LGBTQ people may be more reluctant to seek medical care.  Not your standard Q-tips: Coronavirus test swabs running out as testing ramps up School closings: Will states need to hold kids back, institute summer school because of coronavirus? In addition, the LGBT Cancer Network warns, there are more than 3 million LGBTQ+ elderly people living in the U. S. who are already less likely than their heterosexual and cisgender peers to reach out to health and aging providers, like senior centers, meal programs and other programs designed to ensure their health and wellness because they fear discrimination and harassment.  'A time to pay attention to vulnerable communities' LGBTQ communities are all-too familiar with the phenomena of stigma and epidemics, said Chris Hartman, director of Kentucky's Fairness Campaign. Groups like the Fairness Campaign, SAGE of the Bluegrass and Louisville Pride Foundation have been meeting via conference calls this week to talk about how to provide resources for the Commonwealth's LGBTQ community.  ""Our queer community was wholly ignored for years at the beginning of the AIDS crisis, and we saw where that led,"" Hartman told The Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. ""HIV/AIDS devastated the LGBTQ community . . . unhindered because of the government's intentional inaction as disrespect for LGBTQ people in our community.  ""This is a time to pay attention to vulnerable communities, not just folks who are in the age range at risk of contracting COVID-19,"" Hartman said. ""We need to be talking about people with suppressed immune systems and those who need to be supported most in a time like this. "" Physician Scott Nass was watching closely over the past few months, acutely aware of how COVID-19 may affect his LGBTQ patients.  The Kentucky native who works in Palm Springs, California, knows that HIV and cancer are more common in LGBTQ communities – not only because of lifestyle choices, such as higher smoking rates, but because of prolonged or delayed access to care.  Folks who identify as LGBTQ don't always feel welcome in the health care environment, Nass told The Louisville Courier Journal, pointing to studies that have found they often report episodes of emotional and psychological trauma from their experiences dealing with the health care system.  A fatalist feeling for some: 'If I get it, I get it' It took Louisville lawyer Bruce Kleinschmidt months to find a new primary care doctor after switching from a practice where he says he experienced homophobic comments from his physician.  ""There's a huge problem with finding a primary care doctor to begin with, even when there's not a crisis going on,"" Kleinschmidt said.  As COVID-19 has spread and federal, state and local governments are mandating social distancing in an effort to stop or slow the spread of contagious diseases by restricting contact with people, especially in large groups, Kleinschmidt says he's noticed a common fatalist feeling among his peers in the LGBTQ community – folks saying, ""If I get it, I get it. ""  But the 67-year-old lawyer, who has liver disease, is concerned about his own susceptibility to the virus, and how he may be treated if he needs to seek medical care.  Many states, including Kentucky, do not have laws prohibiting health insurance companies from discriminating based on gender or sexual orientation, according to the Movement Advancement Project.  Even young or healthy LGBTQ people may be less likely to seek care, Nass said.  ""But now that we're dealing with coronavirus, something as simple as asthma could really be the difference between a mild case and being placed on a ventilator in the hospital,"" he said. ""So it's important that we're making sure that folks get into care early. ""  Uncooperative coronavirus patients: Kentucky man who tests positive for coronavirus refuses to stay home; N. J. woman gives fake name Still, 'a sense of resilience in the LGBTQ community' About 80% of the people who get COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms, according to the World Health Organization. But older adults and people with serious chronic medical conditions – including heart disease, diabetes and lung disease – are at higher risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Symptoms include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, as well as pain or pressure in the chest, which can lead to a type of respiratory pneumonia in the lungs.  Doctors are still working on estimating the mortality rate of COVID-19, but it is thought to be higher than most flu strains, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. That is partly because this is a new coronavirus, and people have no immunity to it.  The pandemic is showing us that the country needs to be equipped to take care of a lot of patients in a very short period of time, Nass added – whether that's screening hundreds of people a day through drive-thru tents or on a phone line – to halt the contagion.  ""We're not saying that LGBTQ folks need special treatment in this pandemic, but there needs to be consideration of the disparities in health equity for our community,"" said Nass, who is also the president of GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality.  Nass said there is some concern that young queer people may be turned away from testing if they don't fit the ""at-risk"" age demographic, which is why the LGBT Cancer Network is calling on public health officials to ensure the LGBTQ community is considered and included in the public health response to COVID-19.  ""Hopefully we can draw our attention to the fact that physicians need to create welcoming environments for people of all identities while providing care, especially in this type of pandemic when people are panicking and unsure,"" Nass said. ""I think that's when it's more important than ever to make sure that folks have somewhere that they can turn to. ""  The Louisville Courier Journal contacted the University of Louisville Hospital, University of Kentucky's LGBT-inclusive Transform Health Clinic and Norton Healthcare to learn more about how Kentucky health providers are considering the LGBTQ community in its treatment of COVID-19, but representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment as of press time.  For Hartman and others, there's a sense of resilience in the LGBTQ community.  ""We have survived,"" Hartman said. ""And I know that we will continue to endure and to embrace our community as we have survived so many hardships for so long. It is through the love and mutual support of our very vibrant, diverse and strong community that we get through this before we see the light at the end of this tunnel.

| Jump to first hitSports Night 1998-2000Two seasons, 45 half-hour episodes. Starring Felicity Huffman, Josh Charles, Peter Krause, Robert Guillaume, Joshua Malina, Sabrina Lloyd and William H. Macy.Aaron Sorkin's workplace comedy set behind the scenes of a ""SportsCenter""--esque show.WATCH ... if you like brainy banter, workplace comedies or ""The West Wing."" ""Sports Night"" is Sorkin's first foray into television, and its second season was the same year as first season of ""The West Wing."" Appropriately, though, ""Sports Night"" is lighter, sillier and more fun. It's a backstage look at a ""SportsCenter""--esque show, staffed by appropriately witty and dazzling anchors, producers and staffers. A lack of sports knowledge will not hinder your enjoyment of the series, so don't let that keep you away. The series' zippy dialogue is its own joy, but there's a tremendous emotional depth, compelling political agitation and some gleeful romantic arcs, too.SKIP ... if you hate patter. If Sorkin isn't for you, it really isn't -- and this is not the show that will change your mind. There's also a laugh track in Season 1, which some find off-putting (luckily, it goes away), and absolutely all of the conversations about ""technology"" are laughably awful.HOW TO WATCH IT There's a major dip in quality at the start of Season 2 -- but don't throw in the towel, things pick back up, particularly as William H. Macy's character gains traction. ""Sports Night"" is hugely bingeable, and if that's part of your plan, make sure you can watch Season 1, Episodes 16 through 23 (the season finale) in one big chunk if at all possible.WHERE TO WATCH IT Purchase on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, VuduMargaret LyonsFriday Night Lights 2006-11Five seasons, 76 hourlong episodes. Starring Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton, Taylor Kitsch, Zach Gilford, Scott Porter, Aimee Teegarden, Jesse Plemons and Michael B. Jordan.Texas high school football serves as the backdrop for a searingly emotional, grounded drama.WATCH ... if you want a TV show that will make you feel. Let's be crystal clear: One does not need to like or know anything about football to love ""Friday Night Lights."" In fact, even a deep loathing for aspects of football culture will not harm your ability to enjoy the show's thoughtfulness and authenticity. Kyle Chandler stars as Coach Taylor, not a perfect man necessarily, but a damn good one -- inspiring, committed and half of one of the best marriages TV has ever given us. Coach Taylor is leading football drills and giving stirring pep talks, and sure, the team is playing football, but what we're really doing is learning how to be people of integrity and determination. You've probably heard people say ""clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose."" It stays with you!SKIP ... if you hate anyone tugging your heartstrings. Or if you can't stand stories about teenagers.HOW TO WATCH IT There is a weird plot misstep in Season 2 that people will warn you about. It's not the best plotline in the world, certainly, but power through -- it is nowhere near as catastrophic as some people make it sound. ""Friday Night Lights"" can be pretty bingey, but be careful: It's five seasons, but only 76 episodes (rather than the 110 you might expect), so it goes way faster than you think it will. Also, there will be tears.WHERE TO WATCH IT Amazon Prime, StarzMargaret LyonsPitch 2016-17One season, ten hourlong episodes. Starring Kylie Bunbury, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mark Consuelos and Mo McRae.A pitcher with a killer screwball is called up from the minors to become Major League Baseball's first female player.WATCH ... if you love baseball or feminist heroines who feel like real people. Kylie Bunbury brings charm and psychological depth to her portrayal of Ginny Baker, a pitching phenom and overnight celebrity who could easily have been a too-perfect ""strong woman"" stereotype. Story lines that follow Ginny's life on and off the field are interspersed with scenes from her childhood, as ""The Pitch"" zooms in on the family tensions that underlie her success. But the show also devotes plenty of attention to her wary San Diego Padres teammates, particularly the aging team captain, Mike Lawson (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), and to the high-level power plays that shape sports franchises.SKIP ... if baseball bores you. Unlike ""Friday Night Lights,"" which makes football the backdrop for small-town drama, ""The Pitch"" puts the politics and business of professional sports front and center. Created in partnership with Major League Baseball, it also features extensive game sequences in just about every episode.HOW TO WATCH IT Try not to rush through the 10 episodes, which span a full baseball season. (There's even an all-star break near the middle.) Limiting your viewing to one episode per day will help preserve the sense that time is passing as Ginny's star rises.WHERE TO WATCH IT Purchase on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, VuduJudy BermanPhotographFelicity Huffman, center, with Josh Malina, left, in Aaron Sorkin's show.

No group in America today is more beloved than health-care workers. People sing to them from balconies, tweet about their heroism and memorialize them in portraits with faces bruised by masks.
Recognizing their sacrifices - as well as their essential role - Pennsylvania officials recently adopted new guidelines giving doctors, nurses and others fighting covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, preferential access to scarce ventilators in a shortage.
But the idea makes some uncomfortable. A Maryland panel rejected the priority access, arguing that those sick enough to need the life-sustaining machines would be unlikely to return to their jobs anytime soon and that defining who is and who is not a health-care worker in a crisis is too morally fraught.
While President Trump and members of his coronavirus task force dismiss talk of shortages that would lead to rationing care or equipment, state officials and doctors in U.S. hot spots warn it is inevitable in some places - and that it is coming soon. If - or when - that point is reached, many hospitals would activate grim triage plans that would rank patients based on who is most likely to benefit from the intensive care.
""There are a lot of competing visions of good,"" said Charles Camosy, a Fordham University associate professor of theological and social ethics. ""The number and the gravity of judgments we have to make are astronomical.""
Pregnant women would get extra priority ""points"" in most if not all plans, U.S. hospital officials and ethicists say. This is not controversial. There also has been some discussion about whether high-ranking politicians, police and other leaders should be considered critical workers at a time when the country is facing an unprecedented threat.
The elderly, people with terminal cancer and those with chronic conditions, on the other hand, fare poorly in many plans, as do people with disabilities.
U.S. hospital officials, bioethicists and doctors involved in the closed-door discussions for drafting plans at their institutions say many critical details are still being debated even as the number of people on ventilators climbs higher each day.
Catholic groups have called on hospitals to treat pregnant women as two lives instead of one. AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, has decried age cutoffs for ventilator access in some plans. Last month, the Arc, a disability rights group, filed complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services objecting to plans that disadvantage those with ""severe or profound mental retardation"" or dementia.
Some bioethicists have called for a national plan for rationing that would resolve disagreements and prevent ""hospital shopping"" by patients seeking care in a place that might favor their survival. But others believe a single standard is an impossible ask, given the nation's deep ideological and religious divisions on life-or-death issues.
Bioethicist Brendan Parent, who served on a New York state task force that developed a highly regarded framework for rationing, sees hospitals and states following two paths.
One group takes a utilitarian view of doing ""the greatest good for the greatest number,"" giving preference to those with the best chance of surviving the longest. Others are more focused on ensuring social justice and ensuring vulnerable groups have an equal chance.
Parent said that there may be acrimony over various plans but that the alternative of treating everyone exactly the same - for instance, by using a lottery system - is not compatible with saving the most lives. Calling the plans ""blunt instruments,"" he said they cannot imagine every scenario that might arise, so judgments will ultimately be left to individual doctors and nurses.
""Their use and utility will butt up against some very real, very difficult human problems with regard to how clinicians who are in the trenches are making real-time decisions,"" he said.
Point systems
Despite pleas from New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for more ventilators, and help from billionaire Elon Musk, Ford and GM, there still may not be enough to go around - with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security projecting that as many as 2.9 million people could need ventilators during the course of the pandemic in a severe scenario.
Doctors and nurses also warn of possible shortages of other scarce resources as time goes by, such as some medications and dialysis machines to treat kidney failure.
Two rationing plans reviewed by The Washington Post, a final document from UCLA Health and a draft from Inova Health System, show how point systems can work to prioritize some patients and how small changes can make a big difference in who lives and who dies.
At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, patients with a life expectancy of one year or less - such as some with advanced cancer, or severe heart failure combined with other conditions - would be assigned a lower priority than those with a longer life expectancy, according to the documents.
Robert Cherry, chief medical and quality officer for UCLA Health, said that while the plan doesn't list a specific age as a benchmark, age is ""an indirect marker for chronic illness. The older you get, the more you are likely to have heart disease and other things that impact your survival.""
UCLA's plan states that medical teams may not consider a long list of criteria for ventilator allocation, including gender, disability, race, immigration status, personal relationship with hospital staff or ""VIP status"" - an important reminder given the medical center's proximity to Hollywood. Cherry said it would be irresponsible to not have a framework in place for making difficult decisions.
In UCLA's plan, front-line health-care workers and administrators may be given priority access to lifesaving treatment when their return to work means more people are likely to survive the crisis. If all the allocation criteria are applied and there's still a shortage of medical resources, then care should be allocated on the basis of a lottery, the document says. Patients who do not receive required care would be categorized as ""Do Not Resuscitate,"" with palliative care provided, according to the documents.
In Virginia, Inova Health's draft plan follows similar criteria, except those with chronic conditions face a more severe penalty in the rankings - which makes it less likely that they would get a ventilator even over someone who is sicker from covid-19, according to the plan. Steve Motew, chief clinical officer for Inova, said that discussions are ongoing but that the hospital system wanted to use numerous components to try to capture the likelihood of success of intubation.
""With all candor, these types of question are something none of us want to or have imagined having to think about,"" he said.
UCLA, as an extra precaution against bias, calls for decisions to be made by a special triage officer or team, rather than the group that cares for a patient, with demographic information ""blinded"" when it is passed on to the decision-makers.
Inova takes a different approach by asking the doctor treating a patient to make the decision, with others available for consultation. Motew said that is not only practical for expediency's sake, but also because bedside physicians have personal relationships with patients and can best advocate for them.
""I believe I'd rather have that person who has that compassion holding my hand and providing that comfort to make the decision,"" he said.
Protecting the vulnerable
One of the most striking differences among plans is how they address the elderly and those with disabilities. Some have strict age cutoffs or explicit criteria that disadvantage those with certain conditions. Tennessee's guidelines, for example, exclude people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and end-stage multiple sclerosis, among other conditions. Officials there declined to comment.
Guidelines distributed by Washington state in March recommend that patients with ""loss of reserves in energy, physical ability, cognition and general health"" be considered for transfer to palliative care - which disability advocacy groups have said amounts to leaving people with disabilities to die.
Kristen Maki, a state spokeswoman, said officials share those concerns: ""We are actively updating the guidance language, including applying an equity lens, to ensure the guidance is unequivocally clear in its original intent of nondiscrimination.""
Federal nondiscrimination statutes did not exist the last time the world faced a pandemic of this magnitude, in 1918, so it's unclear how they would be applied to medical triage in an emergency situation, legal experts say. But AARP and disability rights groups say they believe the policies are illegal.
""This virus doesn't discriminate, and neither should those entrusted with deciding who gets access to health care to treat it,"" said Nancy A. LeaMond, AARP executive vice president.
Shira Wakschlag, director of legal advocacy for the Arc, has filed complaints with the HHS Office for Civil Rights against four states that she says have discriminatory provisions in their rationing plans. HHS put out guidance on March 28 stating that ""persons with disabilities should not be denied medical care on the basis of stereotypes, assessments of quality of life, or judgments about a person's relative 'worth' based on the presence or absence of disabilities or age.""
But even without these explicit exclusion criteria, elderly people and those with disabilities remain at a disadvantage. Some plans use age as a ""tiebreaker"" if there are two patients with similar conditions - with preference going to the younger person.
This isn't typically done by chronological age, but by life stages - young adulthood (40 years and younger), middle adulthood (41 to 60 years), late adulthood (61 to 74 years) and those ages 75 and up - with priority going to those who have had the least chance to live through these periods.
Some Catholic hospitals, however, draw only one distinction - between an adult and a child, so that a 70-year-old in need of a ventilator would be considered equal to a 20-year-old based on the principle of human dignity that all people have the same claim to health-care resources.
Using life expectancy or remaining life years can also be problematic for those with disabilities, civil rights groups say. The typical life expectancy for a person with Down syndrome, for example, is 60 years, as compared with about 78 years for someone without the condition.
""The key thing as we are in the midst of discussion about allocation of resources is that we do not forget the most vulnerable in the society,"" said Brian Kane, senior director of ethics for the Catholic Health Association.
The favored
Only a limited number of patients would qualify for bonuses beyond their medical condition. Pregnant women are one such group, and in some plans, they would get one extra ""point"" in the scoring systems used to rank patients for access. But some stakeholders, especially religious groups that believe life begins at conception, have argued they should jump closer to the front of the queue.
In late March, health-care professionals published a provocative article in two of medicine's most prestigious journals arguing for favoring health-care professionals.
Ezekiel J. Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues said that ventilators should go first to front-line health-care workers who care for ""ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating.""
""These workers should be given priority not because they are somehow more worthy, but because of their instrumental value,"" they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh bioethicist and critical-care doctor whose framework was used by Pennsylvania, expressed similar sentiments in JAMA the following week. In his model - co-written with Scott Halpern, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania - he emphasized it would not be appropriate ""to prioritize front-line physicians and not prioritize other front-line clinicians (e.g., nurses and respiratory therapists) and other key personnel (e.g., maintenance staff that disinfects hospital rooms).""
""Most of us are sheltering at home while there is this group of people going toward the danger. We have a reciprocal moral obligation if they suffer from their efforts,"" White said in an interview.
Workers at two major hospital systems said there had been internal debate about whether high-ranking elected officials should be counted as critical workers. One person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak by his employer,  said discussions were in reference to members of Congress. The other, an Inova employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for the same reason, said they had discussed what might theoretically happen if Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) needed a ventilator in a shortage.
""People have really strong views,"" the employee said. ""Some argued that if the governor did not get a ventilator and died, it could be very destabilizing. Others felt that would be the most egregious thing to prioritize him. It could create havoc or undermine public trust.""
Inova's Motew said ethical principles allow for prioritizing ""some individuals who provide more lifesaving opportunities if they could live"" - and that this could include ""government leaders.""
""Particularly in a pandemic,"" Motew said, ""it is one of the factors of the survival of a population.""

| Jump to first hitOfficials are trying to curb expressions of grief and control the narrative amid doubts about the official number of deaths in China.Liu Pei'en held the small wooden box that contained his father's remains. Only two months ago, he had helplessly clutched his father's frail hand as the elderly man took his last breath, and the pain was still raw. He wept.But there was little time, or space, for Mr. Liu to grieve. He said officials in the central Chinese city of Wuhan had insisted on accompanying him to the funeral home and were waiting anxiously nearby. Later, they followed him to the cemetery where they watched him bury his father, he said. Mr. Liu saw one of his minders taking photos of the funeral, which was over in 20 minutes.""My father devoted his whole life to serving the country and the party,"" Mr. Liu, 44, who works in finance, said by phone. ""Only to be surveilled after his death.""For months, the residents of Wuhan had been told they could not pick up the ashes of their loved ones who had died during the height of China's coronavirus outbreak. Now that the authorities say the epidemic is under control, officials are pushing the relatives to bury the dead quickly and quietly, and they are suppressing online discussion of fatalities as doubts emerge about the true size of the toll.China's official death toll from the coronavirus stood at 3,322 on Friday, but medical workers and others have suggested the count should be higher. The C.I.A. has warned the White House for weeks that China vastly understated its epidemic, current and former American intelligence officials say.As China tries to control the narrative, the police in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, have been dispatched to break up groups on WeChat, a popular messaging app, set up by the relatives of coronavirus victims. Government censors have scrubbed images circulating on social media showing relatives in the city lining up at funeral homes to collect ashes. Officials have assigned minders to relatives like Mr. Liu, to follow them as they pick burial plots, claim their loved ones' remains and bury them, grieving family members say.""Where is the dignity after death?"" Mr. Liu asked. ""Where is the humanity?""The ruling Communist Party says it is trying to prevent large gatherings from causing a new outbreak. But its tight controls appear to be part of a concerted attempt to avoid an outpouring of anguish and anger that could be a visceral reminder of its early missteps and efforts to conceal the outbreak. Those same public displays or discussions of loss could also feed skepticism over how China has counted the dead.Wuhan accounted for nearly two-thirds of China's total infections and more than three-quarters of its deaths. But in the early weeks of the outbreak, medical workers said many deaths from the coronavirus weren't counted because of a shortage of test kits.More recently, a truck driver cited in a report by Caixin, an influential newsmagazine, talked about dropping off thousands of boxes for storing ashes at Hankou Funeral Home, one of eight funeral homes in the city. While the numbers raised doubts about the death toll, it was unclear whether the boxes were used for just coronavirus victims or more broadly.The Chinese government says it has been open and transparent about the scale of the outbreak within its borders. But the party also wants to closely orchestrate how the epidemic's victims should be mourned and remembered. It is portraying them as martyrs and compatriots who gave their lives in the fight against the spread of the disease, rather than victims of an outbreak.The government held a nationwide day of mourning on Saturday, the day of the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival, a time for honoring ancestors. Entertainment activities stopped, flags flew at half-staff, and alarms and horns sounded for three minutes starting at 10 a.m.The official mourning will probably not be enough to soothe many families in Wuhan who have chafed against the state's efforts to assert control over the grieving process.Some have demanded justice and accountability from the government, hoping that their loved ones did not die in vain. The government fired two top local officials in February, presumably over the bungling of the initial response, but it has not said if it would conduct further investigations.""I demand an explanation,"" said Zhang Hai, a 50-year-old native of Wuhan whose father, Zhang Lifa, died after he was infected with the coronavirus in a hospital. He wants to know why it took officials weeks to inform the public that the virus could spread among humans. ""Otherwise, I can't give my father closure and I will never be at peace.""Other residents have tried to find their own way to privately memorialize their loved ones with small, makeshift acts of remembrance.Maria Ma, a 23-year-old design teacher at a college in Wuhan, knew that her grandfather would have wanted the family to hold a wake for him in a large tent in which relatives could keep vigil and friends could burn incense.But when he and Ms. Ma's grandmother died in January, his wish couldn't be met. Instead, their bodies were quickly taken away and cremated.With Wuhan under lockdown, Ms. Ma and her family had no choice but to make do with simple rituals at home. They burned ""spirit money,"" wads of paper printed to look like currency, following the custom of ensuring that loved ones have enough to spend in the afterlife. On the 49th day after her grandfather's death, the men in Ms. Ma's family cut their hair, also in line with tradition.Still, she said, the family was racked with guilt over not being able to organize a proper funeral.""We keep asking ourselves, 'How could this have happened to our family?""' Ms. Ma said by phone. ""We are just ordinary people. We never did anything bad to anyone.""In recent days, as the official number of new cases in China has dwindled, the authorities in Wuhan have turned to dealing with deaths. Officials have paid families about $420 for each relative who died during the epidemic, regardless of the cause. Relatives of coronavirus victims are also entitled to a 30 percent discount on burial plots and free cremation services.Some, like Peng Bangwen, are finding that the monetary support doesn't address the stigma of the virus that extends even after death.Mr. Peng wants to bury his father, Peng Andong, who died in early February, in the family's ancestral home outside of Wuhan. But village officials rejected the idea, saying they didn't want the remains of a coronavirus patient there.""Whether it's with a quiet and peaceful funeral, or a grand and ornate funeral, I just want to have it taken care of,"" Mr. Peng, 32, who works at a hotel in Wuhan, said by phone. ""Otherwise it is too cruel, both for me and for him.""Others, like Mr. Liu, the finance worker who buried his father, are struggling to come to terms with their loss.His father, Liu Ouqing, was a respected member of the Communist Party who had led a distinguished life as a civil servant and college administrator and had started enjoying retirement only in recent years. The father and son had grown closer, and the elder Mr. Liu doted on his 11-year-old granddaughter.In January, the elder Mr. Liu had gone to a hospital in Wuhan for a regular checkup. There, he became infected with the coronavirus.His son, who had sneaked into the hospital by pretending to be a patient, said Mr. Liu fought valiantly but knew his end was near. His father told him to look in the bedside drawer, where he had kept notes on his finances and recipes for his granddaughter's favorite dishes.On Jan. 29, he died, with his son by his side.Mr. Liu, devastated, sought out a Buddhist priest, who conducted a ritual in a temple to monitor the state of his father's soul. On some nights, Mr. Liu quietly read Buddhist prayers for his father.Late last month, he received a call from the authorities notifying him to prepare for the burial.Mr. Liu was assigned two officials, one from his father's workplace and the other a local neighborhood worker, who said they were there to provide support. Last week, they went with him to Biandanshan Cemetery, in the city's southwest. He chose the most expensive option, a south-facing plot that had mountains behind it and a lake below. It cost $14,000.They held the funeral two days later. A label had been affixed to his father's blank headstone noting the grave's location: Row 24, Number 19. The tombstone would come later.""Like a house without a door,"" Mr. Liu said. With a marker, he wrote his father's name at the top of the headstone.When the burial was over, the officials asked the family to sign a form indicating that they had completed their assignment.Two days later, Mr. Liu returned to the cemetery. This time, he went alone and spent an hour at his father's grave. ""Wait for me and Mom,"" he told his father. ""One day we will all live together in your new home.""Mr. Liu said he would not stop pressing the government to punish the local officials responsible for initially concealing the outbreak and to provide fair compensation to the families of the victims.""They think that I'll go away now just because I've completed the burial?"" he said. ""No. I'm not finished yet.""Yiwei Wang and Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing. Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong.PhotographLiu Pei'en, left, with his father's remains. Above, Mr. Liu's par- ents' wedding picture.

| Jump to first hitThis ravishing and singular musical, written and directed by Conor McPherson, hears America singing -- Dylan -- during the Great Depression.A nation is broken. Life savings have vanished overnight. Home as a place you thought you would live forever no longer exists. People don't so much connect as collide, even members of the same family. And it seems like winter is never going to end.That's the view from Duluth, Minn., 1934, as conjured in the profoundly beautiful ""Girl From the North Country,"" a work by the Irish dramatist Conor McPherson built around vintage songs by Bob Dylan. You're probably thinking that such a harsh vision of an American yesterday looks uncomfortably close to tomorrow. Who would want to stare into such a dark mirror?Yet while this singular production, which opened on Thursday night at the Belasco Theater under McPherson's luminous direction, evokes the Great Depression with uncompromising bleakness, it is ultimately the opposite of depressing. That's because McPherson hears America singing in the dark. And those voices light up the night with the radiance of divine grace.A fluent fusion of seeming incompatible elements, ""Girl"" occupies territory previously unmapped on Broadway, and it speaks its own hypnotic language. Technically, you could say it belongs to a genre that is regarded by some as the great blight of Broadway: the jukebox musical, which uses back catalogs of popular recording artists as scores.""Girl"" does indeed feature some 20, career-spanning songs by Dylan, who was born in Duluth in 1941. But for this hybrid production, previously staged at London's Old Vic Theater in 2017 and at New York's Public Theater the following year, McPherson has thrown away all the usual jukebox templates.The musical numbers in his portrait of a crowded boardinghouse in a cruel season do not spring organically from the plot. Only rarely does there seem to be a direct connection between Dylan's lyrics and the actions of the characters.Instead, McPherson dares to present music as belonging to a parallel universe, a realm that abuts the dreary reality of the play's here and now but never overlaps it. When the superb ensemble sings -- tenderly, angrily and often ravishingly -- it seems to come from a place their characters could never identify in their conscious minds, but which is essential to their survival.Fate -- and economics, climate and other people -- aren't kind to the denizens of this cold, cold landscape. Music is what they have within themselves to keep warm, to keep moving and to keep hearing hope, even if it's only a whisper.Not that anyone in ""Girl"" -- which has an echoing, imagistic precision you associate with first-rate poetry -- has much reason to hope. At its center is Nick Laine (Jay O. Sanders, an invaluable new addition to the cast), who is facing foreclosure on the big, derelict house from which he rents rooms. He is helped, erratically, by his alcoholic son, Gene (Colton Ryan), and his adopted daughter, Marianne (Kimber Elayne Sprawl), who is inconveniently -- and, it would seem, unaccountably -- pregnant.Nick's wife, Elizabeth (Mare Winningham, fabulous), is suffering from the kind of dementia that has her babbling uncomfortable truths and hitting those who try to help her. Winningham renders madness with the brusque straightforwardness and lopsided wisdom of a Shakespearean fool.Nick is played by Sanders with a hauntingly exhausted rage. Late in the show, he says of himself, ""You live too long, you see too much. It chips away at you .... How can you love someone who ain't got a soul?"" He is perhaps the play's strongest character, and the one furthest beyond hope. It's telling that he's the only person onstage who doesn't sing.The other residents include Mr. and Mrs. Burke (Marc Kudisch and Luba Mason), a squabbling couple of ambiguous provenance, and their son, Elias (Todd Almond), a grown-up with the mind of a child. The widowed Mrs. Neilsen (Jeannette Bayardelle) is waiting in vain for a windfall inheritance; she is also sleeping with Nick.Later arrivals to this makeshift ménage include Reverend Marlowe (Matt McGrath), a Bible-selling man of the (tattered) cloth, and Joe Scott (Austin Scott), a boxer newly out of prison. Regular visitors include Mr. Perry (Tom Nelis), an elderly shoemaker whom Nick hopes might take Marianne as a common-law wife. Then there's Dr. Walker, the local physician and a morphine addict (a pitch-perfect Robert Joy), who serves as a semi-omniscient narrator. Interaction among all them all is fitful, graceless and sometimes potentially violent, as if the rules for social behavior have been long forgotten.You've probably met folks like them before. McPherson is willfully recycling structures and stereotypes of Depression-era plays, blending the heightened naturalism of big-cast social melodramas like Clifford Odets's ""Awake and Sing"" with the homespun eternity of Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town.""That pastiche element annoyed me when I first saw ""Girl,"" with an English cast in London. But I've come increasingly to admire McPherson's use, and subversion, of well-worn tropes to create a collective national sensibility, filtered through decades of memory. ""Girl"" shakes up its cultural clichés -- which may make you think of passed-down, hard-times stories in your own family -- to cut through to the genuine pain of a traumatic chapter in American history.Rae Smith's set and costumes, lighted with a sense of endless night by Mark Henderson, summon a world of frightening impermanence. Even when there's anchoring furniture -- a laden Thanksgiving table, for instance -- you feel that it's all on the brink of disappearing.But consider what's also visible on the stage from the beginning: a radio, a piano, a bass, a set of drums and old-timey microphones on stands. These are the instruments of redemption.Again and again, one of the hapless souls onstage will step up to the mike and lead a Dylan classic in a voice that suggests not thought, but deepest feeling made audible. It could be an achingly wistful ""I Want You"" (sung to perfection by Ryan and Caitlin Houlahan) or an improbably reborn ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" with a tambourine-rattling Winningham flailing like a sheet in the wind.Throughout you become newly aware of themes of rootlessness, isolation, disenfranchisement and -- beyond that -- an upward-reaching spiritualty in the music of Dylan, and you remember he was indeed a child of the Depression. (This show makes a good case for his much-debated Nobel Prize for literature.) Exquisitely arranged by Simon Hale and performed by onstage musicians (who sometimes include cast members, with Mason's jaded Mrs. Burke a knockout on drums), the music has both a plaintive country twang and big-band shimmer.Without ever acknowledging the transition, and later never holding for applause, characters morph into both piquant soloists and members of a celestial backup chorus. The lighting transforms them into phantasmal silhouettes, like blurred figures from an old photograph album. And when they dance (Lucy Hind is the movement director), it's with a paradoxical mix of rough individualism and smooth synchronicity.""As we know, pain comes in all kinds,"" Dr. Walker tells the audience early in the show. ""Physical, spiritual, indescribable."" Those varieties of pain are all palpable in ""Girl,"" and they're never going to be healed. And then the music starts. You don't know where it comes from, or even exactly what it means. But there's no mistaking the sound of salvation.Girl From the North CountryTickets At the Belasco Theater, Manhattan; 212-239-6200, northcountryonbroadway.com. Running time: 2 hours and 30 minutes.PhotographTodd Almond, center, and the ensemble of ""Girl From the North Country."" (C1); Top, from left, Jeannette Bayardelle, Mare Winningham and Matt McGrath.

After the daily practices and team meetings are finished and all the assignments are doled out, the only thing a player can't be prepared for in a game is momentum.
""It's one of those things where you kind of feel it happening on the sidelines,"" former Miami Hurricanes running back Patrick Hill told me last week, ""and you don't want to believe that it's going to happen if you're the one"" it's happening to.
Hill recalled being momentum's beneficiary in 2009, when Miami hosted Oklahoma. He and his teammates were staring at a deficit when they kicked off to start the second half. But Cory Nelms smashed into Sooners returner Mossis Madu and triggered a roar from the Miami home crowd. Two plays later, the Hurricanes forced a fumble. One play more, they took a lead they didn't relinquish for an upset.
""That's kind of the same with this,"" Hill said of the novel coronavirus. ""We . . . control what we can with the social distancing, making sure we adhere to all the protocols, six feet apart, making sure we don't come to work sick. [But] . . . the momentum's definitely on the virus's side.""
Hill didn't make his observation from the sideline. I caught up with him on the front line, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where the former 256-pound fullback is a registered nurse. He had just completed a 12-hour shift in an intensive care step-down unit, a level of care to which healing ICU patients graduate. Hill was looking forward to a rare long string of days off, taking advantage of spring break with his kids, to prepare for the week of April 12.
Models predict that is when California's major metropolitan areas could become the next New York, overrun with coronavirus patients who stretch thin available health-care laborers such as Hill - their protective gear, too - and threaten their health and lives. At least four New York nurses have died amid the outbreak. A nurse in Detroit, where the infection spiked last week, died after telling those close to her she contracted the coronavirus from treating a patient who tested positive.
If there are tougher people in this country right now than the more than 3 million employed as nurses, I don't know them. If there are people that deserve to be lionized in this struggle more than nurses, I don't know them. After all, they make up the infantry in the fight against this pandemic. Yet they had to protest for adequate support from the Trump administration to help them save lives by getting the resources they need to save their own. And most of them are still women, underscoring what most people think of the profession: It's a feminine redoubt for handmaidens. It's not.
But more men are refusing that stigma and entering the trade. At recent glance, more that 12 percent of registered nurses are men, up from 2.7 percent in 1970. And they now include guys such as Hill and Brandon Rice, a former UCLA School of Nursing graduate program cohort. Both climbed out of that cauldron of testosterone and toxic masculinity known as college football to join nursing's ranks and, maybe surprisingly, pronounce it the toughest thing they have done and now the most frightening.
""A lot of people said that [masculinity] was a strong point; they were looking for male nurses, for what we brought to the table in terms of just strength,"" Rice, who starred as a wide receiver at UC Davis, said recently.
Rice works 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in a cardiac ICU at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Medical Center. He said he first heard about the coronavirus in January when management told the staff the airports and ports were checking disembarking foreign travelers. But the reality of the impending health crisis didn't ring with him until after the Grand Princess cruise ship was stalled in San Francisco Bay in mid-March because of an outbreak among its passengers. Two eventually died.
""They were saying they needed to get those patients into the hospitals and some of them might come here,"" Rice said. ""Two weeks later, they started seeing a spike in cases. Then we really started prepping. Do we have enough [personal protection equipment] to handle this?""
The protocols changed. Rice's temperature was tested each day he reported for work. He started wearing a mask all the time.
""Our management has done a really good job of continuing to talk to us and prep us,"" Rice said. ""But it's also scary when you're at work and someone starts coughing.""
Rice explained that Kaiser San Francisco has two units for severe heart patients, including a cardiovascular unit and a coronary intensive care unit.
""If we start to get the influx that they're predicting, a spike in [coronavirus] cases in this area in the next week or two, then we're going to start taking those patients up in the cardiovascular unit as well,"" Rice said.
So Rice and his colleagues wait. Not knowing. Just hoping. To survive the sniper of a virus creeping into their midst.
I asked Rice whether football prepared him for the fight before him.
""Football has taught grit, teamwork, work ethic and, also if you were to drop a ball, how to deal with something like that, something negative that happens that you had control over,"" he said, ""how to overcome those situations.
""And working with a team . . . would be the most prominent learning thing from football. Because when it really comes down to saving a patient's life, if their heart stops and we have to resuscitate the patient, there's a team atmosphere. And that's all you do in football.
""But in terms of getting ready for the impending doom,"" Rice considered, ""I don't think there are too many lessons from football I can draw on.""

"THE WORLD; Mexico's health workers face intimidation; Accused of spreading virus, nurses and others endure verbal and physical attacks.","Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitEsther Garcia was walking toward a bus stop after completing her shift when a young man approached her. Then he tossed a plastic bag filled with liquid at her.
The bag struck the side of her head, splashing her face with its caustic contents -- a mixture of water and bleach. The attacker ran off as Garcia felt burning in her eye and her vision went blurry.
""I was filled with fear,"" she recalled. ""I started to cry. I didn't understand what was going on.""

This wasn't a revenge attack, a crime of passion or some kind of message from Mexican organized crime.
Garcia is a nurse at a public clinic outside Mexico City.
Health workers, especially nurses, have been targeted across the country in recent weeks by assailants accusing them of spreading coronavirus, health professionals and authorities say.
Apart from being sprayed with bleach, they have faced verbal assaults, been denied seats on public transport and been blocked from entering their own communities.
""You are spreading COVID!"" is a common slur.
Mexican authorities, including President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, have condemned the mistreatment and stressed that it has been perpetrated by a scattered minority in a country where most citizens have lauded the workers on the front lines of the pandemic.
""It is truly outrageous that anyone would attack health personnel because of fear of COVID-19,"" Dr. Hugo Lopez-Gatell, who heads the government's coronavirus response team, tweeted this week. ""They are here to protect us. Our total gratitude.""
In the state of Oaxaca, lawmakers passed a statute mandating nine-year prison terms for assaults on medical professionals.
The medical workers are already risking their lives to care for COVID-19 victims. Across Mexico, doctors, nurses and others have staged protests against a lack of protective gear, supplies and medicines.
More than 500 health workers have already been infected, authorities say, and at least nine have died. Outbreaks have been reported in at least four public hospitals -- in Tijuana, near Mexico City, in San Jose del Cabo and in Monclova, in the northern state of Coahuila.
The reports of infected health workers have left a stigma, stoking fears on social media and elsewhere that they are vectors of contagion.
In western Jalisco state, at least six nurses have been victimized, including one who, like Garcia, was showered with water and bleach, according to the state nursing association there.
""As health workers we have confronted disinformation and panic -- even physical and verbal aggression,"" Edith Mujica, president of the group, told reporters.
""We are not enemies. ... People should know that just because we are nurses that is not to say that we are contaminated.""
Across Mexico, townsfolk have put up ""sanitary"" roadblocks -- staffed with self-styled health vigilantes -- to prevent entry of outsiders and other potential virus carriers. The barriers have meant some health workers cannot get home, forcing them to move.
In one case, reported Mexico's Reforma newspaper, residents denied a nurse entry to her neighborhood in the Pacific coast town of Bahia de Banderas, in Nayarit state.
""We don't deserve this,"" the nurse, Melody Rodriguez Navarrete, said afterward. ""We are not asking them to praise us, only that they understand that we are here to help them. It's our work and everyone is taking the appropriate measures not only to avoid becoming infected, but to avoid infecting others.""
Along with outrage, the assaults on health workers have prompted national soul-searching about the collective mentality behind such misguided behavior.
""The assaults demonstrate an accumulation of contradictions in our society,"" columnist Javier Solorzano Zinser wrote Friday in La Razon newspaper. ""Those who are being attacked put all their determination and knowledge into resolving problems, not into provoking them.""
Mexico is not alone in the disturbing phenomenon. Similar attacks against health workers have been reported in India and elsewhere, including the United States.
Traditionally, nurses and other health workers in Mexico have been figures of considerable respect. On crowded public buses and trains, people routinely give up seats to nurses in white uniforms and health workers in lab coats.
Now, to avoid drawing scrutiny, health-sector commuters are being advised to wear civilian garb on public transportation, and to change clothes at their workplaces. In some cases, authorities are arranging dedicated transport to shield workers from ill-treatment.
In Mexico City, unions representing transit workers and health employees this week launched a special bus service for employees at seven public hospitals.
""They are victims of attacks despite the fact that they are at the front lines of the battle,"" Gerardo Garcia, secretary-general of a health workers local, told Reforma.
In the case of Esther Garcia, 46, who has been a nurse for 18 years, her vision returned to normal, but the bleach assault has left a legacy of fear and distrust.
She is a divorced single mother of two daughters, ages 19 and 17, whom she helps support on her nurse's salary of about $700 a month. Like many fellow health workers, she cannot afford to leave her job.
""I don't even want to think about what would have happened if they had a gun or some other weapon, instead of just bleach,"" Garcia said. ""I feel very sad. ... In this profession one recognizes that you run the risk of contagion of some illness. But I have never before felt fear that I would be attacked because I was a nurse. Never before.""

| Jump to first hitAlabama Montgomery: The state has agreed to remove old ventilator triage guidelines that advocates said discriminated against the elderly and disabled, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday. The difficult decisions about who could get a ventilator if there aren’t enough for all who need one have taken on new urgency as intensive care units prepare for surges in patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal officials cautioned states and doctors that civil rights laws still apply and that decisions on who gets a ventilator should not be based on stereotypes about a person’s worth. The Alabama document, created a decade ago during the H1N1 pandemic, included factors such as profound intellectual disabilities and severe dementia in weighing against providing the potentially life-saving treatment. The Alabama Department of Public Health said a new plan had since been created, and those older guidelines don’t apply.  Alaska Juneau: ConocoPhillips is demobilizing its rig fleet on Alaska’s North Slope to try to minimize the risk of workers contracting COVID-19, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. This means drill rigs will stop drilling and be placed in long-term storage, company spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said by email. Wells currently in production will continue producing oil, she said. The effort is aimed at reducing the number of ConocoPhillips’ workers on the North Slope. Lowman said it’s unclear how long the measures will be in place. ConocoPhillips is one of the major oil companies operating in Alaska. Last week, BP Alaska announced one of its workers had tested positive and said it was eliminating nonessential activity on the North Slope. Kara Moriarty, president and CEO of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, by email said the current situation – COVID-19 and low prices caused by tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia – has been a “double hit to the industry. ” Arizona Phoenix: Domestic violence has increased as more people remain home during the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. The Phoenix Police Department dispatched officers to 3,587 domestic violence calls in March as travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders were implemented to combat the spread of COVID-19, KTAR-FM reports. That represented a 5. 6% increase in officers responding to reports of family fights or aggravated assault of domestic partners compared to March 2019, police said. Sgt. Mercedes Fortune said the reports appeared to increase more after Gov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order March 31. Police received 942 domestic violence calls in the first week of April, a 15% increase from the same time last year, Fortune said. “Regardless of the health crisis we are in right now, I think this serves as a reminder for people to be kind to each other and have a little more patience,” Fortune said.  Arkansas Little Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson spoke to lawmakers wearing face masks and spread out across two locations – including a basketball arena – as they met Wednesday for a legislative session against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis. With schools and many businesses closed because of the pandemic, the Republican governor told lawmakers he’ll need their help cutting his proposed budget. “We are here today for regular business at a time in our world when everything seems irregular,” Hutchinson told a sparsely filled Senate chamber during his State of the State address. His remarks were broadcast live to the 5,600-seat Jack Stephens Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, which was serving as a makeshift House chamber. “We will maintain our commitment to funding public education, public safety and Medicaid, but to do so we will need to have some reserve funds with flexibility and oversight to be sure there is no gap in essential services,” he said.  California Sacramento: The state plans to spend nearly $1 billion to buy up to 200 million masks each month to boost its stockpile of protective gear during the coronavirus outbreak, an eye-popping figure meant to turn the state into a distributor of medical equipment for other Western states struggling with supply shortages. Gov. Gavin Newsom made the announcement on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show Tuesday night. “As a nation-state with a capacity to write a check for hundreds of millions – no, billions of dollars – we are in a position to do something bold and big that could be a catalyst to increase supply,” Newsom said. “We want to be there for our fellow governors. ” Meanwhile, the city of Los Angeles has embarked on a massive effort to bring thousands of homeless people off the streets and into hotels to protect them and others from infection. Newsom announced last week that money from the federal government would help pay for at least 15,000 hotel rooms during the pandemic. But Los Angeles County, with the state’s largest concentration of homeless people at about 60,000, has set its own goal of 15,000 rooms. “We’re going big in L. A. ,” said Heidi Marston, interim director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.  Colorado Fort Collins: The state’s newest beer festival is coming to your living room. In an effort to support local breweries while under the statewide stay-at-home order, Colorado’s first-ever – and hopefully last – virtual beer festival will be held this weekend. People can virtually attend the Shelter-in-Place (SIP) Beer Fest from noon to 6 p. m. Saturday. Attendees are asked to buy a $5 “ticket” for the festival, then – if they’re 21 years old or older – support local breweries, wineries and distilleries by ordering for pickup or delivery. Of-age attendees are encouraged to drink local beers, wines and spirits and post photos and videos on social media using the hashtag #SIPBeerFest. The beer fest is organized by a local craft brewery podcast called Unfiltered and sponsored by Denver-based app Handoff, which recommends and delivers beer, wine and spirits. All funds raised through ticket sales and $1 from every delivery through Handoff during the festival will be donated to Colorado craft brewery employees affected by layoffs due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Connecticut Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration laid out plans Wednesday for segregating nursing home residents who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 to help prevent further spread of the disease, while nursing home workers continued to express concerns about not having the equipment and staffing they need to stay safe on the job. Members of SEIU 1199 New England, the largest health care union in Connecticut, told stories of workers wearing garbage bags for protection and reusing gear that normally would be tossed after a single use. Of the 69 homes staffed with District 1199 workers, 55 have confirmed cases of COVID-19, and eight have suspected cases. “We are reusing masks. Some of us have limited access to gloves. We don’t have access to gowns,” said Chelsea Daniels, an LPN at Fresh River Healthcare in East Windsor, a 144-bed skilled nursing facility. “We are at risk, and nobody seems to care. ” Delaware Milford: A distillery owner threatened to point a shotgun at anyone who tries to enter his store wearing a mask. Eric Fibelkorn made the threat Sunday in a Facebook post that was later deleted, saying people who come into Feebs Distilling Co. in Milford with a mask on would “be met with a 12-gauge to the face. ” Fibelkorn posted the message shortly after the Centers for Disease Control released guidance advising people to wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Fibelkorn defended his message, saying while he understands customers wanting to follow the guidelines, he cannot risk a robbery. Now he’s installing lockers so patrons can call ahead and pick up their bottles without coming into the store. “We consider it an attempted armed robbery if someone walks in with a mask on, and that’s why we’re eliminating people coming in 100%,” he said. Milford and Delaware State Police said they haven’t seen an increase in crimes by people wearing masks.  District of Columbia Washington: Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a new order Wednesday evening requiring that all food retailers enforce social distancing protocols and declared that outdoor markets are no longer essential businesses, WUSA-TV reports. All farmers’ markets, including the Fish Market at the Wharf, that wish to operate must obtain a waiver. In order to apply for a waiver, “a market manager must submit a plan to the District government at dcfoodpolicy@dc. gov to outline how they will operate and enforce social distancing protocols, and that plan must be approved. ” According to Bowser, the order’s safety and social distance protocols apply to all retail food sellers, which include grocery stores, supermarkets, food halls, food banks, convenience stores and other establishments engaged in the retail sale of food. The order does not apply to restaurants preparing food for takeout and delivery, nor to schools or senior citizens preparing free food for the public.  Florida Miami Beach: Two months ago, the Miami Beach Convention Center hosted tens of thousands of cheering and laughing Super Bowl guests visiting the NFL’s traveling museum and interactive displays. Now it is filled around-the-clock with members of the Army Corps of Engineers performing the grim task of setting up a 450-bed overflow hospital in case South Florida facilities become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Gov. Ron DeSantis visited Wednesday, saying the corps assured him it would be ready by April 21, when models show the disease could be nearing its statewide peak. He said the hospital could be expanded to hold 1,000 beds if needed. “I would rather be prepared for the worst and the worst not come here than not be prepared,” DeSantis said. “We don’t know what a surge may bring. ” Georgia Atlanta: The state on Thursday postponed primary elections for the second time this year because of the coronavirus, pushing back primaries scheduled for May to June. “This decision allows our office and county election officials to continue to put in place contingency plans to ensure that voting can be safe and secure when in-person voting begins and prioritizes the health and safety of voters, county election officials, and poll workers,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement. The first-term Republican had already opted to postpone Georgia’s presidential primaries, initially scheduled for March 24, to May 19 to coincide with the state’s other 2020 primary elections. Georgians were scheduled then to choose party nominees for a U. S. Senate seat, U. S. House members, and members of the state House and Senate. Elections for judges and district attorneys were also set for May 19.  Hawaii Honolulu: Officials said Wednesday that they have identified a cluster of COVID-19 cases at the only hospital on Maui as the facility disclosed 15 employees have tested positive. Maui Mayor Michael Victorino said the Maui Memorial Medical Center employees have been sent home to self-isolate. He said plans were being made to isolate the workers at a quarantine site away from their families. Bruce Anderson, the director of the state Department of Health, said the first case at the hospital was identified in mid-March, and many of the initial cases were related to travel. He said it was only Tuesday when the state epidemiologist saw the connections between subsequent cases and recognized the virus had likely been transmitted between workers and from patient to worker. He said all those who have had close contact with the employees will be tested.  Idaho Boise: Another 31,000 residents filed for unemployment benefits last week as the state economy shed thousands of jobs for the third consecutive week, officials said Thursday. The Idaho Department of Labor said nearly 78,000 people have filed claims since mid-March. “Given the prognosis that we’re not going to return to normal anytime soon, we’re looking at dealing with this incredible influx of claims for a while,” said the agency’s director, Jani Revier. The labor department said workers of all ages are being affected in the latest round of layoffs, with hard-hit sectors including accommodations, food services, health care and construction. Those categories accounted for 57% of the layoffs for the week from March 29 to Saturday. Revier said the best way to file a claim is online, as high call volume is leading to long wait times with some callers unable to get through. She said the agency is hiring and training additional workers.  Illinois Chicago: The county that includes Chicago is setting up new places to store bodies in preparation for a likely surge in the number of coronavirus deaths that could overwhelm hospital morgues. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle’s office said in a news release Thursday that a 66,000-square-foot refrigerated warehouse located 5 miles from the medical examiner’s office would be up and running by the end of the day. The facility, according to the release, will be able to hold more than 2,000 bodies. The county’s Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security has also acquired 14 refrigerator trailers and is in the process of securing six more. Chicago, which has long been plagued by gun violence, has also in recent days been hit by a rash of shootings that is taxing the medical examiner’s office at a time when it is dealing with more and more coronavirus deaths.  Indiana Greensburg: The coronavirus pandemic surged into three farm-speckled Indiana counties much faster than most other parts of rural America, contributing to at least 10 deaths and dozens of serious illnesses. Decatur County and two other counties in southeast Indiana have among the highest per capita infection rates in the country, topping the Seattle area and some counties near hard-hit Detroit. Last Thursday, county officials banned nonessential travel and ordered all restaurants closed, including for takeout orders, going beyond the requirements of the governor’s stay-at-home order. Decatur, Franklin and Ripley counties have a combined population of nearly 78,000 people and nearly 250 confirmed coronavirus cases through Wednesday, placing them among the top 100 counties for high infection rates across the nation, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. Health leaders can’t pinpoint why the area has such a high infection rate, but some point to truckers stopping off from Interstate 74 – the main route between Indianapolis and Cincinnati – and locals who work in those cities.  Iowa Iowa City: Weeks into the coronavirus outbreak, hospitals have been ordered to report daily statistics to the state on the number of patients they’re treating and whether they have enough resources. The Iowa Department of Public Health issued an order April 3 requiring hospitals to report every day on the number of COVID-19 patients they have hospitalized, in intensive care and on ventilators. The hospitals are also required to report on the beds and equipment they have available for patients and their supply of personal protective gear. Gov. Kim Reynolds has said repeatedly that data is driving her decisions on how to manage the outbreak. Iowa Department of Public Health deputy director Sarah Reisetter said Wednesday that the mandatory order was necessary because hospitalization numbers haven’t always been accurate or timely. Reisetter said a 17% jump in hospitalizations reported Wednesday reflected the improved data collection, not a surge in new patients.  Kansas Mission: Gov. Laura Kelly’s executive order restricting the size of religious gatherings amid the coronavirus outbreak was overturned Wednesday after the state’s top prosecutor said it likely violates the state constitution. With Easter just days away, the Legislative Coordinating Council voted 5-2 to undo the order that limited in-person religious services and funerals to 10 people. The now-overturned order had rescinded an earlier order that barred most gatherings with more than 10 people, with exceptions for religious gatherings and funerals, raising questions about whether large gatherings were now legally permitted. Kelly said legal staff is reviewing the matter. “This has created confusion,” Kelly, a Democrat, said at a news conference while blaming politics. “This has created chaos. ” The council’s vote came after Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican, said that while the order was “sound public-health advice that Kansans should follow,” he was discouraging law enforcement agencies and prosecutors statewide from attempting to enforce the requirements.  Kentucky Frankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear issued an order Wednesday to limit shopping to one person per household, stepping up efforts to enforce social distancing as coronavirus cases continue escalating in Kentucky. The governor reported 204 new virus cases across Kentucky, a new one-day high. It raised the state’s total cases to 1,346 since the global pandemic hit the Bluegrass State. He reported eight more virus-related deaths, bringing the statewide death toll to 73. Meanwhile, Kentucky residents who lost their jobs amid the economic damage from the pandemic will receive a boost in unemployment benefits. Beshear announced that $600 unemployment supplements from the federal government will be available as soon as Thursday evening. “This is going to be a significant help,” the governor said during his daily briefing.  Louisiana Baton Rouge: Hundreds of Carnival cruise ship workers who have tested negative for the coronavirus disease disembarked in New Orleans and are returning to their home countries, the governor’s office said Thursday. The Carnival Valor, a New Orleans-based ship that typically carries about 3,000 guests for Caribbean cruises, didn’t have passengers when it arrived to its home port Wednesday night. Meanwhile, Louisiana has seen encouraging signs this week in its fight against the virus outbreak. The governor credits people physically distancing from others and avoiding trips away from their homes as much as possible with helping to slow the rate of new infections – and he’s cautioned Louisianans to keep it up. He’s also warned that until the country finds a virus treatment and vaccine, “I don’t know that you’re going to see life as we knew it before COVID-19. ” Maine Augusta: The number of Mainers filing for unemployment continues to grow as businesses furlough workers during the coronavirus pandemic. There were approximately 30,900 unemployment claims in the week ending April 4, setting a new weekly high for the third week in a row, the state Department of Labor said Thursday. Last week’s total compares with about 800 claims in the same period last year. Commissioner Laura Fortman said her staff is trying to keep pace with the sudden increase. Meanwhile, cellphone data and figures from the state Department of Transportation show Mainers are doing a good job of practicing social distancing, said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control. Traffic on I-95 in Kittery, near the New Hampshire border, is down 61%, while traffic on I-295 in Portland is down 62%, and travel on rural roads is down 30% to 40%, Shah told reporters.  Maryland Annapolis: The state reported available data on cases and deaths by race for the first time Thursday. The data shows black residents have had more cases of the virus and deaths in Maryland, even though African Americans make up only 29% of the population. The health department is reporting the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has climbed to at least 6,185, an increase of 656 cases since Wednesday. There have been a total of 138 deaths from the virus reported in Maryland. Some 2,064 African Americans have had the disease, compared to 1,540 cases among white residents. There have been 55 deaths among African Americans, compared to 39 deaths among white residents. There have been 122 cases among Asians and six deaths. Data is not available on 1,354 cases involving 21 deaths. “Today, we are able to publish 75% of the currently available data, which shows troubling disparities and points to a persistent public health challenge that we must address,” Gov. Larry said on Twitter.  Massachusetts Boston: A group of marijuana dispensaries has sued Gov. Charlie Baker over his decision to shut down recreational pot operations in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The lawsuit filed Wednesday asks the court to allow recreational pot shops to reopen, saying the closure will cause serious harm to the industry. The Republican governor says keeping the stores open would harm the state’s ability to control the spread of the virus because they draw many customers from other states where recreational marijuana remains illegal. “Significant numbers of the customers who procure cannabis at recreational marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts are not from Massachusetts,” Baker said Wednesday. “Making those sites available to anybody from the northeast would cut completely against the entire strategy we’re trying to pursue. ” Medical marijuana providers are classified as essential.  Michigan Detroit: The mayor said Wednesday that the coronavirus is “starting to weaken” in the state’s largest city, but he also pleaded with residents to keep the momentum going by wearing masks and avoiding large groups. Health officials, meanwhile, reported that Michigan has had 20,346 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 959 deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. There were fewer new cases and deaths reported Wednesday than Tuesday. “We are starting to weaken it,” Mayor Mike Duggan said. “If we don’t give it new energy by clustering, we are going to be successful. ” Cooler weather could help discourage outdoor gatherings: After temperatures reached 70 degrees in parts of the state Wednesday, they were expected to top out in the 40s and 50s starting Thursday and stretching into next week.  Minnesota Minneapolis: The Minnesota Department of Health reported 11 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, the state’s largest one-day increase since the pandemic began, raising the total to 50. The department also reported 88 new confirmed cases Thursday to boost Minnesota’s total to 1,242. The department said 145 patients were hospitalized as of Thursday, an increase of 10, while 63 were in intensive care, a decrease of one. Health officials caution that the numbers represent only confirmed cases and that the actual numbers of cases across Minnesota are much higher because not everyone qualifies for testing. Also Thursday, Democrats kept up the pressure on Republicans to temporarily approve expanded voting by mail for the August primary and November general elections. Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Ken Martin, Sen. Nick Frentz of North Mankato and Rep. Jamie Long of Minneapolis pointed to Tuesday’s chaotic election in Wisconsin as an example of what they’d like to avoid.  Mississippi Oxford: A doctor who was fired after raising concerns about her hospital’s safety measures in the coronavirus pandemic is now suing. News outlets report Dr. Samantha Houston was fired from Oxford’s Baptist Memorial Hospital after she wrote a Facebook post soliciting donations for equipment to communicate remotely with coronavirus patients. The post caused some confusion and was later edited to clarify that patients were being seen in-person by doctors and nurses, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Ayoka Pond, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Houston’s assertion that the hospital did not have capability to speak remotely with coronavirus patients was false. She also denied Houston’s other accusation: that the hospital did not have enough N95 masks for nurses treating coronavirus patients.  Missouri Columbia: Another roughly 91,000 Missourians filed unemployment claims amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to state data for the week that ended Tuesday. Data from the state’s labor department shows unemployment claims dropped from the previous week’s more than 104,000 claims. But claims still are significantly up. Claims for the past week were more than eight times higher than in all of April 2019. The uptick in unemployment claims this year began in mid-March. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has said Missouri’s Department of Labor and Industrial Relations is overwhelmed by the number of calls from people with questions about filing for unemployment. He said the agency bumped up staffing to about 100 people to answer questions. Workers can also file unemployment claims online.  Montana Great Falls: The Fort Peck Tribes have reported two cases of COVID-19, believed to be the first among the state’s seven Indian reservations. The confirmation was posted Wednesday on the Fort Peck Assiniboine & Sioux COVID-19 information Facebook page. State Medical Officer Dr. Greg Holzman said Tuesday that “there were no known cases associated directly with the tribal reservations” and that 3. 5% of those who had tested positive in Montana were Native American. The tribes are encouraging their members not to panic, to stay indoors, and to wear gloves and masks if they need to go outdoors. The tribes had already suspended tribal government travel, implemented a 14-day quarantine for anyone who came to the reservation from a place with an outbreak and instituted at 10 p. m. curfew. “The reason we’re doing that is because we have a high rate of diabetes here, a high rate of cancer and a high rate of heart disease. We’re thinking about our elders,” Tribal Chairman Floyd Azure said in an earlier statement.  Nebraska Kearney: A third staff member and three residents at Nebraska’s Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney have tested positive for the new coronavirus, state health officials reported. Those were the results released late Wednesday of facility-wide testing earlier this week after two staff members initially tested positive for COVID-19. The local health department and the Nebraska National Guard set up the on-site testing for the center’s more than 160 residents and staff. The infected staffer is self-isolating and monitoring symptoms at home, health officials said. The three boys are asymptomatic and self-isolating in individual rooms at the center, officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that “necessary areas” in the facility have been sanitized and that all staff and youth continue to be monitored for symptoms, including having their temperature checked daily.  Nevada Las Vegas: The governor on Wednesday ordered a closure of golf courses, real estate open houses and religious gatherings of 10 people or more, as well as additional restrictions to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Steve Sisolak said he was adding restrictions because some people have created an unnecessary risk by trying to circumvent the rules he has already put in place. Other restrictions were designed to cut down on the amount of time people spend next to others, he said. Sisolak said he was ordering the closure of sports and recreational facilities where people congregate, such as golf courses, tennis courts, basketball courts and pools. He said that despite his decision last month to leave golf courses open, he had seen pictures that had been sent to him of people riding together in golf carts and standing together on the greens. The governor said a new directive also restricts barbers and hair stylists from offering in-home services to anyone outside their immediate household. “I haven’t had a haircut in six weeks. I’ve adjusted. The first lady is sticking by my side. We can do this,” the governor joked.  New Hampshire Concord: The state received 15 machines from the federal government that confirm within minutes if someone tests positive for the coronavirus – but it can’t use them due to a lack of test cartridges. The state expected 1,500 cartridges for the machines but only received 120. “I’m banging my head against the wall, I really am,” Gov. Chris Sununu said Wednesday. “It’s really frustrating. We’re going to keep pushing on Washington multiple times a day to get what we need. ” U. S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying she finds it “unacceptable” that the state won’t be able to use the machines to the fullest extent possible.  New Jersey Trenton: Jobless claims spiked 32% last week, breaking a record set the week before, and Gov. Phil Murphy promised Thursday that no one owed jobless benefits will be denied despite delays because of the state’s old computer system. The spike in claims to about 206,000 from 155,000 reflects the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the state’s economy, according to the Labor Department. The state’s unemployment website has been deluged with applicants, slowing it down and leading officials to ask people to try the site at off-peak times. “No one will be denied one penny of their benefits,” Murphy said Thursday. The hardest-hit workers were from the food service industry, followed by those at doctors’ and dentists’ offices, the department said. Administrative workers were also hit hard.  New Mexico Farmington: New Mexico State Police are cracking down on businesses that aren’t abiding by the governor’s public health orders as new confirmed cases pushed the state’s total higher Wednesday. The cases include two residents and seven employees at a Farmington nursing home. Numerous cases also have been reported at an Albuquerque long-term care facility. Every resident at the Farmington nursing home has been tested now. Life Care Centers of America aid staff can help coordinate video chats and phone calls so family members can stay connected to loved ones who are inside the facility. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this week extended an emergency health order that aims to limit social contact to keep from spreading the virus. The order also includes restrictions for businesses, and state police have said that for those that aren’t abiding by the rules, a written warning along with a cease-and-desist order will come first. On a second violation, the business will receive a citation. Subsequent violations could lead to a civil penalty of up to $5,000.  New York New York: The state reported a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day, though trends on hospitalizations were more hopeful. State health officials now say they support people covering their faces in public, while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city needs more coronavirus testing capacity. The state’s 799 deaths in one day raised the outbreak total above 7,000. Despite the worsening death toll, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, New York City’s hospitals have so far stood up under the enormous strain. In fact, the increase in hospitalizations is down from the unsustainable pace of last week, as are intensive care admissions. More than 18,000 patients were hospitalized in the state. Light is at the end of the tunnel, but New Yorkers absolutely must not end their weeks of isolation just yet, he said. “It is good news. ‘Well, now I can relax,’ No, you can’t relax,” he cautioned. “The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that. ” North Carolina Wrightsville Beach: This beach town is increasing fines for people who violate beach closures in light of rules established as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials in Wrightsville Beach say if people are caught on the beach in violation of the public beach closures, they could face fines of up $650 and potential court costs, WWAY reports. Before the change, offenders faced a misdemeanor that carried a $150 fine. After handing out 18 citations to people violating public beach closures over the weekend, the town said changes were needed. Town leaders passed an ordinance allowing police to charge anyone caught on the beach with a $500 civil penalty up to the officer’s discretion. Former Wrightsville Beach mayoral candidate Greg Buscemi suggested the only reason for the change is the loss of parking revenues. Mayor Darryl Mills said the change was meant to give officers some flexibility and an alternative to giving someone a criminal record.  North Dakota Fargo: Plans are in place to convert the state’s largest sports venue into a field hospital in case it’s needed for COVID-19 patients, Fargo officials said Thursday. The Fargodome is an indoor stadium that seats 19,000 fans for North Dakota State University football games and has held major concerts and other events. The National Guard and state officials are prepared to set up about 200 beds and health stations in the venue, if needed, Mayor Tim Mahoney said. “The governor has control of beds that he can deliver wherever he wants in the state,” Mahoney said. The National Guard has already set up more than 200 cots at the University of Mary Fieldhouse in Bismarck. The Armory at Bismarck State College was considered, but Gov. Doug Burgum said officials determined the space was too small. As of Thursday, there were 14 patients who were hospitalized in North Dakota with COVID-19, occupying a small percentage of the 2,400 beds available in current medical facilities around the state.  Ohio Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has urged institutions with surgical masks not to throw them away but to arrange for them to be sanitized by Battelle, a private research company in Columbus that has developed a technology allowing masks to be reused up to 20 times. Apple CEO Tim Cook has donated 100,000 N95 masks for health care workers, the governor announced. Cook is giving the virtual commencement address at Ohio State next month. The Ohio Hospital Association released guidelines for how hospitals can allocate scarce resources, including ways to implement a triage group to determine who should receive resources when they’re not available for all patients. And in central Ohio, 44 staff members agreed to live in two assisted-living facilities, The Inn at Chapel Grove in Heath and The Inn at SharonBrooke in Newark, to reduce the risk of exposure to residents, The Advocate reports. “I never thought in my whole nursing career that this would even happen, but I came to realize that in my entire nursing career, this is the time that they’re going to need me the most,” nurse Alisha Disbennett told the newspaper.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: A hospital system has temporarily closed all but its emergency room and some outpatient services at a facility in the city and will furlough employees because of a drop in patient numbers due to a state ban on elective surgeries during the coronavirus crisis. An unspecified number of patients are being moved from Integris Baptist Medical Center Portland Avenue in northwest Oklahoma City to another Integris Health hospital in the city by Friday, company spokeswoman Brooke Cayot said Thursday. She said Integris doesn’t know how long that campus will be closed, but the company hopes it will reopen in the future. Gov. Kevin Stitt in March issued an executive order suspending elective surgeries and minor medical procedures to preserve supplies of protective equipment such as gloves, masks and face shields.  Oregon Portland: Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday that the state’s K-12 schools will remain closed though the end of the academic year due to the coronavirus outbreak, placing more than 550,000 students and their teachers in uncharted territory as districts with vastly different resources plan for weeks of remote learning. Seniors who had passing grades and were on track to graduate when the state’s stay-at-home order began in mid-March will be able to graduate, Brown said. School districts are being explicitly urged to work closely with seniors who did not have passing grades at that time to help them earn those credits so they can graduate, said Colt Gill, the director of the Department of Education. Those students will have until Aug. 31 to improve their grades and graduate with the Class of 2020, he said. Proms, graduation ceremonies and other year-end celebrations will be put on hold or held online, Gill said. District are being urged to work with students and parents to come up with an alternative way to celebrate that fits each community, he said.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board said Thursday that it might increase the number of fulfillment centers to handle the tremendous demand for its new online sales program. The state’s brick-and-mortar liquor stores were shut down March 17 over coronavirus concerns. The online order system has been getting upward of 2 million page hits a day since it launched last week, but the vast majority of would-be customers have been unable to place an order because of the program’s lack of fulfillment capacity. The program filled 684 orders on its first day and was up to about 1,800 orders per day this week, board spokeswoman Elizabeth Brassell said. She said the relative few who successfully placed orders have been getting delivery within two days. The existing fulfillment centers, staffed with employees and contract workers, are in Pittsburgh, the Philadelphia suburbs and Wilkes-Barre.  Rhode Island Providence: The governor said Thursday that the state nearly doubled its coronavirus testing over the past week, and she announced tough new restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the outbreak. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said the state is now conducting more than 1,800 tests daily, well over her goal a week ago of 1,000 tests a day. “I’m not going to pretend it’s perfect … but we’ve made enormous progress,” Raimondo said. Testing sites were set to close Thursday afternoon because of lightning in the forecast, she said. Most of the state’s testing is conducted outside in drive-up tents that contain metal equipment. Raimondo also signed an executive order intended to double down on forced quarantines and isolation for people who have been diagnosed with the virus or had close contact with someone who has. “This is going to get harder, not easier,” she said. “It’s necessary to help keep everyone healthy, safe and alive. ” South Carolina Columbia: The Legislature’s attempt to meet as quickly as possible Wednesday to assure the state can keep operating while lawmakers stay out of session and safe from the peak of the coronavirus outbreak ran into a familiar roadblock in a surprising way. Several senators opposed a bill to allow the state to keep spending money if it doesn’t pass a budget by the end of June because it placed restrictions on state-owned utility Santee Cooper. House Speaker Jay Lucas said the failure of negotiations over Santee Cooper meant the House and Senate also couldn’t reach an agreement to set the parameters of any special session needed after the May 14 deadline in the state constitution for the session to end. And the Senate altering the House’s bill means the House will have to come back in session and deal with the new proposal before June 30 or risk the state no longer being able to spend money.  South Dakota Sioux Falls: A pork processing plant operated by Smithfield Foods has seen more than 80 of its employees confirmed to have the coronavirus, health officials reported Wednesday. United Food and Commercial Workers, the union representing employees at the Sioux Falls plant, said the number of people with confirmed cases is higher at more than 120. Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said her number was based on information from Tuesday. The plant, which employs about 2,800 people, has emerged as a hot spot of infections in the state, with almost 1 in 4 people who have tested positive in South Dakota working at the plant. Employees said in the past two weeks they have felt pressured to go to work even when they felt sick. Smithfield Foods said it is taking precautions to protect its workers, including screening them for signs of COVID-19 before they enter the facilities.  Tennessee Nashville: The legal team fighting for a delay in the June 4 execution of a death row inmate says it has lost “critical time” due to the new coronavirus and restrictions to curb its spread. In a state Supreme Court filing Wednesday, the attorney for inmate Oscar Smith cited increasingly stringent government restrictions, including Gov. Bill Lee’s stay-at-home order, in response to a state coronavirus caseload that rose Wednesday to 79 deaths and more than 4,300 people confirmed to have been infected. Meanwhile, many more Tennesseans are losing their jobs as economies shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Tennesseans filed more than 112,400 new claims for unemployment in the week ending Saturday, according to the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The numbers have risen sharply, to nearly a quarter of a million over the last three recorded weeks. Typically, the state gets fewer than 10,000 new claims in a three-week period, the department said.  Texas San Antonio: Ten residents at the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center have died after a coronavirus outbreak infected most of the people living there, officials said Wednesday. That means more than half of 20 reported coronavirus-related deaths in the city are linked to the nursing home. The most recent victims were two women, one in her 70s and the other in her 80s, city officials said in a statement. At least 67 of 84 residents at the facility tested positive for COVID-19, and several staff members were infected as well. The virus has swept through other Texas nursing homes, including one in Texas City, where a doctor is treating nearly 30 people with an anti-malaria drug that has been heavily promoted by President Donald Trump but is unproven to be effective against COVID-19.  Utah Salt Lake City: Travelers coming into the state will be required to identify themselves and report any coronavirus symptoms as they arrive, Gov. Gary Herbert said Wednesday. Highways will be “geofenced” at the five most common entry points so drivers get a text message through a federal wireless emergency alert system asking them to fill out an online form if they are staying in the state, authorities said. At the Salt Lake International Airport, people will hand out cards with a QR code linking to the form starting Friday. The form will have people identify themselves and report their recent travels as well as any symptoms. People who could spread the virus will be asked to self-quarantine and possibly get tested. The effort will get federal funding, and the information will be stored in a secure Utah Department of Health database.  Vermont Burlington: All 95 senior nursing students at the University of Vermont are going to be graduating early this year so they can support health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, school officials said Thursday. Vermont’s State Board of Nursing will offer the students temporary permits so they can begin staffing hospitals and other health facilities immediately after they graduate May 1, the university said. The nurses had been scheduled to graduate in late May. Normally, new graduates begin work in early August, after they’ve taken a licensure exam and become registered nurses. “Healthcare workers need support as soon as we can provide it,” Rosemary Dale, chair of the Department of Nursing in UVM’s College of Nursing and Health Sciences, said in a statement. “Our students will be able to make a real difference. ”  Virginia Falls Church: Nearly 150,000 Virginians filed unemployment claims in the past week, the third straight week of record-setting claims in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. The U. S. Department of Labor said Thursday that 149,758 claims were filed in the state in the week ending April 4. That’s about a one-third increase over the previous week, which was itself record-setting. Before the coronavirus forced so many businesses into stasis, weekly jobless claims in Virginia averaged about 2,600. In the past three weeks, more than 308,000 Virginians have applied for unemployment, according to the Labor Department. The real figure may be higher because the Virginia Employment Commission, like other states, has been overwhelmed by the volume of claims, and many applicants report difficulties in getting their claims filed and processed.  Washington Seattle: Inmates at a state prison staged a large protest following new coronavirus diagnoses at the facility. Inmates at the Monroe Correctional Complex held a demonstration Wednesday night after six inmates tested positive at the prison, according to the Washington State Department of Corrections. The latest two cases at the facility that can house up to 2,500 inmates were men ages 68 and 28. Corrections officers used verbal orders, pepper spray and rubber pellets to get the demonstrators under control, but the inmates ignored those efforts, officials said. Both housing units were evacuated, and the situation was under control soon afterward. No one was injured. Gov. Jay Inslee said Thursday that he recognizes the concerns inmates and their families have about the virus inside correctional facilities and is trying to balance inmate needs with public safety.  West Virginia Charleston: At least 14 West Virginia University students have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to college officials. The school said Wednesday night that the students were in private, off-campus housing and that a contact-tracing investigation is underway. The college has been closed since March 20. Monongalia County, where the school is located, is counted among the state’s virus hot spots and is subject to stronger safety protocols along with Marion, Berkeley, Jefferson, Morgan, Harrison and Kanawha counties. Gatherings in those counties have been limited to five people, and local health departments have been told to establish maximum occupancy rules for businesses, after executive orders from Republican Gov. Jim Justice. At least 485 people in West Virginia have the virus, according to state health officials. At least four people have died.  Wisconsin Madison: Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday ordered the closure of 40 state parks, forests and recreational areas primarily in southern and southeastern Wisconsin to help reduce overcrowding and vandalism and to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Evers warned that the order could be followed by more closures if the public doesn’t follow social distancing guidelines and if vandalism continues. “Unfortunately, growing difficulty with ensuring social distancing compliance, dwindling cleaning supplies and mounting trash are some of the challenges faced by our state parks staff,” Evers said in announcing the closures, which include Devil’s Lake State Park, the Kettle Moraine State Forest, Blue Mound State Park, Governor Dodge State Park, New Glarus Woods State Park and Dells of The Wisconsin River State Natural Area. Also on Thursday, Evers reiterated that it was OK for churches to offer drive-up services on Good Friday and Easter after the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty and religious groups asked for clarity.  Wyoming Cody: Yellowstone National Park likely won’t reopen until May or later, delaying the start of its traditional summer season for millions of tourists because of the coronavirus outbreak, a park official said. “I don’t foresee us opening in the month of April,” park Superintendent Cam Sholly told Park County commissioners in a conference call Tuesday. “It’s going to be closer to May, and then we’ll see what the virus is doing in Montana and Wyoming and around the country for that matter. ” The coronavirus has complicated the usual pattern from late April to early June of plowing snow and then reopening gates, visitor centers, stores, restaurants and lodges for tourists who begin to converge on Yellowstone around Memorial Day weekend, the Cody Enterprise reports.

| Jump to first hitStigmatized as vectors of contagion in some countries, health care workers have been assaulted, abused and ostracized.MEXICO CITY -- The senior nurse went on national television to make a plea on behalf of her fellow health care workers: Please stop assaulting us.Nurses working under her auspices had been viciously attacked around Mexico at least 21 times, accused of spreading the coronavirus. Many were no longer wearing their uniforms as they traveled to or from work for fear of being hurt, said the official, Fabiana Zepeda Arias, chief of nursing programs for Mexico's Social Security Institute.""We can save your lives,"" she said, addressing the assailants. ""Please help us take care of you, and for that we need you to take care of us.""In many cities, doctors, nurses and other health care workers have been celebrated with choruses of applause and cheers from windows and rooftops for providing the front-line defense against the pandemic.But in some places health care workers, stigmatized as vectors of contagion because of their work, have been assaulted, abused and ostracized.In the Philippines, attackers doused a nurse with bleach, blinding him. In India, a group of medical workers was chased by a stone-throwing mob. In Pakistan, a nurse and her children were evicted from their apartment building.Dozens of attacks on health care workers have been reported in Mexico, where intense outbreaks among hospital staff of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, have unnerved residents and members of the medical community alike. Scores of doctors and nurses have fallen ill in several hospitals around the country, and widespread demonstrations have erupted among health care workers complaining about inadequate protective equipment.Nurses in the state of Jalisco reported being blocked from public transportation because of their occupation. A nurse in Culiacán, the capital of the state of Sinaloa in Mexico's northwest, said she was drenched with chlorine while walking along the street.In Merida, a city on the Yucatán Peninsula, a nurse said he was hit with an egg thrown by someone passing on a motorcycle.Ms. Zepeda Arias, who spoke last week at a news conference, said 21 of her Social Security Institute nurses had been attacked in the past month.""It hurts to talk about this, it hurts to talk about what happens to your people,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""Aggression is not something that anyone wants. We truly invite you to respect us.""The attacks against medical workers seem to be rooted in fear and ignorance fed by misinformation, said Edith Mujica Chávez, the president of the Inter-Institutional Commission of Nurses in the state of Jalisco.""It is understandable, considering how much uncertainty and misinformation there is out there,"" she said in an interview. ""You have some people panicking and locking themselves in their houses, others thinking nothing will happen to them and going around carefree, and others thinking it is nurses and doctors who will spread the virus because we are in contact with patients.""Mexico moved more slowly than other countries in the region to require social distancing and encourage people to stay home, and the number of coronavirus cases has risen sharply in recent weeks. On Sunday night, government officials reported 14,677 confirmed cases in the country and 1,351 deaths.The authorities have said that the confirmed cases include more than 500 health care workers.Mexican officials have condemned the aggression against doctors and nurses and characterized the episodes as isolated.At a news conference on Friday night, Dr. Hugo López-Gatell, a deputy health minister, called the attacks and discrimination against medical crews working to keep the country safe ""extremely worrying, absolutely unacceptable.""""All of this is inexplicable to a certain extent, it is surprising,"" he said. ""Precisely the people who have the best possibility and the best intention of helping -- the health workers who are on the front line of response -- are attacked for the fact that they are health workers.""Scattered accounts of hostility have circulated around the world.In the Philippines, a nurse in the southern province of Sultan Kudarat was attacked by five men who thought he was infected with the virus because of his work. They poured bleach on his face, leaving him with what his doctors said could be permanent damage to his eyesight.In a televised speech this month, the country's president, Rodrigo Duterte, warned that people who discriminated against health care workers would be dealt with swiftly.""I want to order the police to arrest anyone who harasses them,"" he said. "" Once in prison, do not feed them. Let them starve.""In India, health care workers have reported being physically attacked, spat at and threatened with sexual violence for treating patients with the coronavirus.Doctors in protective gear were chased by a stone-throwing mob early this month in the central city of Indore after they tried to screen a woman for Covid-19.""They screamed, 'Catch them! Hit them!""' one of the doctors, Zakia Sayed, recalled in an interview with India Today, a television network. ""We don't know how and why the situation got so bad.""Reports of health care workers being blocked from their homes by fearful neighbors -- or evicted altogether by landlords -- have proliferated in several countries.Ghazala Bhatti, a nurse in Karachi, Pakistan, and the mother of three children, said her landlord had asked her to vacate their apartment because of fears that she would infect others in the building after treating Covid-19 patients.""The landlord told me that he is worried about the health of his 72-year-old father battling cancer, who also lives on the first floor of the building,"" said Mrs. Bhatti, who moved in with her brother because she was unable to find a place to rent with the city on lockdown.""I am heartbroken,"" she said. ""I have never felt afraid to be a nurse until it happened.""A doctor at a government hospital in the state of Odisha, in India, filed a police complaint against residents of her apartment building after they accused her of spreading the virus. In her statement, the doctor said one resident threatened her with rape if she did not move out.Dr. Sanjibani Panigrahi, who works at a hospital in the Indian city of Surat, said neighbors had tried to bar her from entering her building, telling her she should be ""shunted out of society.""""I don't know how long I can stay here,"" she said in an interview. ""There is so much panic and hysteria right now. Being a doctor has become a stigma.""Reporting was contributed by Paulina Villegas from Mexico City, Jason Gutierrez from Manila, Zia Ur Rehman from Karachi, Pakistan, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.PhotographSoldiers posted outside a hospital in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.

| Jump to first hitLast June, ""Red Table Talk"" tackled the subject of polyamory. Adrienne Banfield-Norris, one of the hosts, said that she thought polyamory was just an excuse to have sexual relations with more than one person.""I'm listening to you guys and I'm trying to stay open-minded,"" she said. ""But my gut tells me this is a bunch of frackle nackle.""That kind of frankness has earned Ms. Banfield-Norris, 66, a loyal following. (By the end of the episode, she said she had a better understanding of why multiple people may enter into a relationship.) Ms. Banfield-Norris hosts the show on Facebook Watch with her daughter, the actress and producer Jada Pinkett Smith, 48, and her granddaughter Willow Smith, 19, an artist.""I think people have this idea that Jada and I are so close and it's this amazing mother-daughter relationship,"" Ms. Banfield-Norris said in an interview. ""It absolutely is not. And I don't think that we've ever tried to portray it that way. I think people want to believe that it is that.""For most of Ms. Pinkett Smith's upbringing, Ms. Banfield-Norris struggled with drugs. She said that when she graduated at the top of her nursing school class at Coppin State University, she was in the throes of an addiction to heroin.Things fell apart further when Ms. Banfield-Norris's mother died, which also left Ms. Pinkett Smith with one less escape from a dysfunctional home.Compared with Ms. Banfield-Norris's connection with Willow (who, along with family, friends and some of the ""Red Table Talk"" crew, calls her Gammy), which she described as ""lighthearted and fun,"" her relationship with Ms. Pinkett Smith is much more serious.Today, Ms. Banfield-Norris has been sober in recovery for 29 years. When asked how her relationship with her daughter was mended, she said, ""People have to actually see and experience the change in you. And that's what Jada saw. That's what Jada saw in me.""A different episode of ""Red Table Talk"" was set to premiere on March 23, but, like much of the world during the new coronavirus pandemic, they pivoted it to discuss the recent events.Recently, the whole family, including Ms. Pinkett Smith's husband, Will Smith, and her stepson, Trey Smith (her son Jaden had been traveling, so he was self-isolating to protect Gammy), hosted two episodes on the spread of the new coronavirus. They brought on Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and Ramani Durvasula, a psychologist, to talk about managing health and anxiety. On April 6th, a new episode will discuss addiction during the time of coronavirus.""For me, it was also about trying to give people back some of their power in a time when people are feeling powerless,"" Ms. Banfield-Norris said.As for Ms. Banfield-Norris, she's ""practicing social distancing, but I am not isolating."" She's staying in touch with family and friends, but limiting how much time she spends on social media.Ms. Banfield-Norris's UpbringingMs. Banfield-Norris was born in Baltimore in 1953; her father was a physician and her mother was a social worker. ""We were the epitome of black middle class,"" she said.She grew up going to the Baltimore Ethical Society, a congregation founded in 1950 that supports all religions and spiritual beliefs. Today Ms. Banfield-Norris considers herself a Christian.""I'm still dealing with the effects of segregation and the civil rights movement and all kinds of topics around the issue of race,"" she said of the era in which she was born. ""And then in the state that the country is in right now, it just sends you back. It sends you back when you're trying to move forward.""At times, Ms. Banfield-Norris said, her opinions on race, infidelity and forgiveness can come off as ""harsh"": ""Sometimes I think, too, part of my issue is that I am very old school in my thinking.""Starting 'Red Table Talk'Conversations between Ms. Banfield-Norris, Ms. Pinkett Smith and Willow started years before the show began in 2018.""Willow had been asking questions,"" Ms. Banfield-Norris said. ""And it dawned on Jada that there's a lot of things that Willow just doesn't know about us."" There were no lights or camera crew, but there was a kitchen table. One day, Ms. Pinkett Smith decided to record. The first video was posted in 2013.In February 2019, Jordyn Woods appeared on ""Red Table Talk"" after it was reported that she was romantically involved with Tristan Thompson, a basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the father of Khloé Kardashian's daughter. Ms. Woods had previously been close to the Kardashian-Jenner family.The Woods and Smith families are longtime friends; Ms. Woods's late father was a sound engineer on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" the 1990s television show that starred Mr. Smith.The Jordyn Woods episode of ""Red Table Talk"" was viewed 33 million times and helped make the show a place where celebrities and everyday people could further explain their choices or struggles.""As women, we've all let our little-girl behavior get us into some grown-woman mess,"" Ms. Banfield-Norris said of the situation with Ms. Woods.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]On another episode, Angela Tucker, a black woman adopted by white parents, said that she sometimes felt ""fear"" around other black people.While Ms. Pinkett Smith and Willow offered support, Ms. Banfield-Norris said, ""The thing that is troubling me just a little bit and I'd want you to clarify, if you can, is your use of the term 'fear.' The fear of black people. Where is that coming from that you use that term?""(Ms. Tucker followed up with a blog post and said: ""A more accurate statement is that as a result of several experiences being rejected by black culture, there have been times when I felt an illegitimacy."")Chelsea Handler has appeared on the show to discuss white privilege; Demi Moore -- along with two of her daughters, Rumer and Tallulah Willis -- joined to talk about her recovery from drug abuse; and T.I. came on after experiencing widespread backlash for saying he accompanies his daughter to her annual gynecology appointment to ensure her hymen is intact.In 2019, ""Red Table Talk"" was Facebook Watch's No. 1 original series in the United States, based on viewership. Its Facebook group has over 600,000 members.Outside of the occasional television or film appearance in connection to her daughter, this is Ms. Banfield-Norris's first on-camera job. In the future, she hopes to do voice-over work.""The only reason I actually agreed to it was because it was Jada, and I knew that I would be safe,"" she said. Still, ""it has not been that comfortable. Sometimes I do have a hard time on the show finding my voice. It's difficult.""Despite her uncertainty at times, Ms. Banfield-Norris has become the gut check of the show that has gained her a new following. She's the one the camera pans to when a guest or fellow host says something that needs a little more explaining. She offers the raised eyebrow. The extra blink. Or maybe she leans forward, puts her hand out and asks a question to help the guest get to where they're going.Her Life TodayThese days, Ms. Banfield-Norris lives in Baltimore and Los Angeles, where she recently bought a home, with her husband, Rodney Norris, 63. This is her fourth marriage and they have been married for three years.Part of her recovery includes fitness and staying active, which she describes as part of her ""get better plan."" The gym has helped her not only with sobriety (she also abstains from alcohol), but with codependency as well. She also likes to Chicago-style step -- a form of swing dancing -- and roller skates twice a week at Skateland in Northridge, Calif.""I think there is so much stigma attached to addiction, and people have in their mind's eye about what they think that person looks like, where they came from, who that person is,"" she said. ""You have no idea.""She is also traveling and reading books, some that are part of her 12-step program for addiction recovery. With ""Red Table Talk,"" she hopes to send a reminder that older women are still vibrant.""I would really like to bring women my age back to the forefront,"" she said.PhotographSober for 29 years, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, top, hopes to remove some of the stigma attached to addiction. Above left, she roller skates twice a week. Above right, Ms. Banfield-Norris with her daughter Jada Pinkett Smith and granddaughter Willow Smith in 2008.

| Jump to first hitTerrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.Whether they can keep it suppressed remains to be seen. But for the United States to repeat their successes will take extraordinary levels of coordination and money from the country's leaders, and extraordinary levels of trust and cooperation from citizens. It will also require international partnerships in an interconnected world.There is a chance to stop the coronavirus. This contagion has a weakness.Although there are incidents of rampant spread, as happened on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said Dr. David L. Heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the World Health Organization on emergencies.No one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless. ""You can contain clusters,"" Dr. Heymann said. ""You need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.""But doing so takes intelligent, rapidly adaptive work by health officials, and near-total cooperation from the populace. Containment becomes realistic only when Americans realize that working together is the only way to protect themselves and their loved ones.In interviews with a dozen of the world's leading experts on fighting epidemics, there was wide agreement on the steps that must be taken immediately.Those experts included international public health officials who have fought AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, flu and Ebola; scientists and epidemiologists; and former health officials who led major American global health programs in both Republican and Democratic administrations.Americans must be persuaded to stay home, they said, and a system put in place to isolate the infected and care for them outside the home. Travel restrictions should be extended, they said; productions of masks and ventilators must be accelerated, and testing problems must be resolved.But tactics like forced isolation, school closings and pervasive GPS tracking of patients brought more divided reactions.It was not at all clear that a nation so fundamentally committed to individual liberty and distrustful of government could learn to adapt to many of these measures, especially those that smack of state compulsion.""The American way is to look for better outcomes through a voluntary system,"" said Dr. Luciana Borio, who was director of medical and biodefense preparedness for the National Security Council before it was disbanded in 2018.""I think you can appeal to people to do the right thing.""In the week since the interviews began, remarkable changes have come over American life. State governments are telling residents they must stay home. Nonessential businesses are being shuttered.The streets are quieter than they have been in generations, and even friends keep a wary distance. What seemed unthinkable just a week ago is rapidly becoming the new normal.What follows are the recommendations offered by the experts interviewed by The Times.Scientists must be heardThe White House holds frequent media briefings to describe the administration's progress against the pandemic, often led by President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by a rotating cast of officials.Many experts, some of whom are international civil servants, declined to speak on the record for fear of offending the president. But they were united in the opinion that politicians must step aside and let scientists both lead the effort to contain the virus and explain to Americans what must be done.Just as generals take the lead in giving daily briefings in wartime -- as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf did during the Persian Gulf war -- medical experts should be at the microphone now to explain complex ideas like epidemic curves, social distancing and off-label use of drugs.The microphone should not even be at the White House, scientists said, so that briefings of historic importance do not dissolve into angry, politically charged exchanges with the press corps, as happened again on Friday.Instead, leaders must describe the looming crisis and the possible solutions in ways that will win the trust of Americans.Above all, the experts said, briefings should focus on saving lives and making sure that average wage earners survive the coming hard times -- not on the stock market, the tourism industry or the president's health. There is no time left to point fingers and assign blame.""At this point in the emergency, there's little merit in spending time on what we should have done or who's at fault,"" said Adm. Tim Ziemer, who was the coordinator of the President's Malaria Initiative from 2006 until early 2017 and led the pandemic response unit on the National Security Council before its disbanding.""We need to focus on the enemy, and that's the virus.""Stop transmission between citiesThe next priority, experts said, is extreme social distancing.If it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all Americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six feet apart, epidemiologists say, the whole epidemic would sputter to a halt.The virus would die out on every contaminated surface and, because almost everyone shows symptoms within two weeks, it would be evident who was infected. If we had enough tests for every American, even the completely asymptomatic cases could be found and isolated.The crisis would be over.Obviously, there is no magic wand, and no 300 million tests. But the goal of lockdowns and social distancing is to approximate such a total freeze.To attempt that, experts said, travel and human interaction must be reduced to a minimum.Italy moved incrementally: Officials slowly and reluctantly closed restaurants, churches and museums, and banned weddings and funerals. Nonetheless, the country's death count continues to rise.The United States is slowly following suit. International flights are all but banned, but not domestic ones. California has ordered all residents to stay at home; New York was to shutter all nonessential businesses on Sunday evening.But other states have fewer restrictions, and in Florida, for days spring break revelers ignored government requests to clear the beaches.On Friday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said he advocated restrictive measures all across the country.In contrast to the halting steps taken here, China shut down Wuhan -- the epicenter of the nation's outbreak -- and restricted movement in much of the country on Jan. 23, when the country had a mere 500 cases and 17 deaths.Its rapid action had an important effect: With the virus mostly isolated in one province, the rest of China was able to save Wuhan.Even as many cities fought their own smaller outbreaks, they sent 40,000 medical workers into Wuhan, roughly doubling its medical force.In a vast, largely closed society, it can be difficult to know what is happening on the ground, and there is no guarantee that the virus won't roar back as the Chinese economy restarts.But the lesson is that relatively unaffected regions of the United States will be needed to help rescue overwhelmed cities like New York and Seattle. Keeping these areas at least somewhat free of the coronavirus means enacting strict measures, and quickly.Stop transmission within citiesWithin cities, there are dangerous hot spots: One restaurant, one gym, one hospital, even one taxi may be more contaminated than many identical others nearby because someone had a coughing fit inside.Each day's delay in stopping human contact, experts said, creates more hot spots, none of which can be identified until about a week later, when the people infected there start falling ill.To stop the explosion, municipal activity must be curtailed. Still, some Americans must stay on the job: doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers; police officers and firefighters; the technicians who maintain the electrical grid and gas and phone lines.The delivery of food and medicine must continue, so that people pinned in their homes suffer nothing worse than boredom. Those essential workers may eventually need permits, and a process for issuing them, if the police are needed to enforce stay-at-home orders, as they have been in China and Italy.People in lockdown adapt. In Wuhan, apartment complexes submit group orders for food, medicine, diapers and other essentials. Shipments are assembled at grocery warehouses or government pantries and dropped off. In Italy, trapped neighbors serenade one another.It's an intimidating picture. But the weaker the freeze, the more people die in overburdened hospitals -- and the longer it ultimately takes for the economy to restart.South Korea avoided locking down any city, but only by moving early and with extraordinary speed. In January, the country had four companies making tests, and as of March 9 had tested 210,000 citizens -- the equivalent of testing 2.3 million Americans.As of the same date, fewer than 9,000 Americans had been tested.Everyone who is infected in South Korea goes into isolation in government shelters, and phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Where they walked before they fell ill is broadcast to the cellphones of everyone who was nearby.Anyone even potentially exposed is quarantined at home; a GPS app tells the police if that person goes outside. The fine for doing so is $8,000.British researchers are trying to develop a similar tracking app, albeit one more palatable to citizens in Western democracies.Fix the testing messTesting must be done in a coordinated and safe way, experts said. The seriously ill must go first, and the testers must be protected.In China, those seeking a test must describe their symptoms on a telemedicine website. If a nurse decides a test is warranted, they are directed to one of dozens of ""fever clinics"" set up far from all other patients.Personnel in head-to-toe gear check their fevers and question them. Then, ideally, patients are given a rapid flu test and a white blood cell count is taken to rule out influenza and bacterial pneumonia.Then their lungs are visualized in a CT scanner to look for ""ground-glass opacities"" that indicate pneumonia and rule out cancer and tuberculosis. Only then are they given a diagnostic test for the coronavirus -- and they are told to wait at the testing center.The results take a minimum of four hours; in the past, if results took overnight, patients were moved to a hotel to wait -- sometimes for two to three days, if doctors believed retesting was warranted. It can take several days after an exposure for a test to turn positive.In the United States, people seeking tests are calling their doctors, who may not have them, or sometimes waiting in traffic jams leading to store parking lots. On Friday, New York City limited testing only to those patients requiring hospitalization, saying the system was being overwhelmed.Isolate the infectedAs soon as possible, experts said, the United States must develop an alternative to the practice of isolating infected people at home, as it endangers families. In China, 75 to 80 percent of all transmission occurred in family clusters.That pattern has already repeated itself here. Seven members of a large family in New Jersey were infected; four have already died. After a lawyer in New Rochelle, N.Y., fell ill, his wife, son and daughter all tested positive.Instead of a policy that advises the infected to remain at home, as the Centers for Disease and Prevention now does, experts said cities should establish facilities where the mildly and moderately ill can recuperate under the care and observation of nurses.Wuhan created many such centers, called ""temporary hospitals,"" each a cross between a dormitory and a first-aid clinic. They had cots and oxygen tanks, but not the advanced machines used in intensive care units.American cities now have many spaces that could serve as isolation wards. Already New York is considering turning the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary hospital, along with the Westchester Convention Center and two university campuses.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Saturday that state officials were also considering opening isolation wards.In China, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, leader of the World Health Organization's observer team there, people originally resisted leaving home or seeing their children go into isolation centers with no visiting rights -- just as Americans no doubt would.In China, they came to accept it.""They realized they were keeping their families safe,"" he said. ""Also, isolation is really lonely. It's psychologically difficult. Here, they were all together with other people in the same boat. They supported each other.""Find the feversBecause China, Taiwan and Vietnam were hit by SARS in 2003, and South Korea has grappled with MERS, fever checks during disease outbreaks became routine.In most cities in affected Asian countries, it is commonplace before entering any bus, train or subway station, office building, theater or even a restaurant to get a temperature check. Washing your hands in chlorinated water is often also required.""They give you a sticker afterward,"" said Dr. Heymann, who recently spent a week teaching in Singapore. ""I built up quite a collection.""In China, having a fever means a mandatory trip to a fever clinic to check for coronavirus. In the Wuhan area, different cities took different approaches.Cellphone videos from China show police officers knocking on doors and taking temperatures. In some, people who resist are dragged away by force. The city of Ningbo offered bounties of $1,400 to anyone who turned in a coronavirus sufferer.The city of Qianjiang, by contrast, offered the same amount of money to any resident who came in voluntarily and tested positive.Some measures made Western experts queasy. It is difficult to imagine Americans permitting a family member with a fever to be dragged to an isolation ward where visitors are not permitted.""A lot of people's rights were violated,"" Dr. Borio said.Voluntary approaches, like explaining to patients that they will be keeping family and friends safe, are more likely to work in the West, she added.Trace the contactsFinding and testing all the contacts of every positive case is essential, experts said. At the peak of its epidemic, Wuhan had 18,000 people tracking down individuals who had come in contact with the infected.At the moment, the health departments of some American counties lack the manpower to trace even syphilis or tuberculosis, let alone scores of casual contacts of someone infected with the coronavirus.Dr. Borio suggested that young Americans could use their social networks to ""do their own contact tracing."" Social media also is used in Asia, but in different ways.China's strategy is quite intrusive: To use the subway in some cities, citizens must download an app that rates how great a health risk they are. South Korean apps tell users exactly where infected people have traveled.When he lectured at a Singapore university, Dr. Heymann said, dozens of students were in the room. But just before he began class, they were photographed to record where everyone sat.""That way, if someone turns up infected later, you can find out who sat near them,"" Dr. Heymann said. ""That's really clever.""Contacts generally must remain home for 14 days and report their temperatures twice a day.Make masks ubiquitousAmerican experts have divided opinions about masks, but those who have worked in Asia see their value.There is very little data showing that flat surgical masks protect healthy individuals from disease. Nonetheless, Asian countries generally make it mandatory that people wear them. In China, the police even used drones to chase individuals down streets, ordering them to go home and mask up.The Asian approach is less about data than it is about crowd psychology, experts explained.All experts agree that the sick must wear masks to keep in their coughs. But if a mask indicates that the wearer is sick, many people will be reluctant to wear one. If everyone is required to wear masks, the sick automatically have one on and there is no stigma attached.Also, experts emphasized, Americans should be taught to take seriously admonitions to stop shaking hands and hugging. The ""W.H.O. elbow bump"" may look funny, but it's a legitimate technique for preventing infection.""In Asia, where they went through SARS, people understand the danger,"" Dr. Heymann said. ""It's instilled in the population that you've got to do the right thing.""Preserve vital servicesFederal intervention is necessary for some vital aspects of life during a pandemic.Only the federal government can enforce interstate commerce laws to ensure that food, water, electricity, gas, phone lines and other basic needs keep flowing across state lines to cities and suburbs.Mr. Trump has said he could compel companies to prioritize making ventilators, masks and other needed goods. Some have volunteered; the Hanes underwear company, for example, will use its cotton to make masks for hospital workers.He also has the military; the Navy is committing two hospital ships to the fight. And Mr. Trump can call up the National Guard. As of Saturday evening, more than 6,500 National Guard members already are assisting in the coronavirus response in 38 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.High-level decisions like these must be made quickly, experts said.""Many Western political leaders are behaving as though they are on a tightrope,"" said Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. special envoy on Covid-19 and a veteran of fights against SARS, Ebola and cholera.""But there is no choice. We must do all in our power to fight this,"" he added. ""I sense that most people -- and certainly those in business -- get it. They would prefer to take the bitter medicine at once and contain outbreaks as they start rather than gamble with uncertainty.""Produce ventilators and oxygenThe roughly 175,000 ventilators in all American hospitals and the national stockpile are expected to be far fewer than are needed to handle a surge of patients desperate for breath.The machines pump air and oxygen into the lungs, but they normally cost $25,000 or more each, and neither individual hospitals nor the federal emergency stockpile has ever had enough on hand to handle the number of pneumonia patients that this pandemic is expected to produce.New York, for example, has found about 6,000 ventilators for purchase around the world, Governor Cuomo said. He estimated the state would need about 30,000.The manufacturers, including a dozen in the United States, say there is no easy way to ramp up production quickly. But it is possible other manufacturers, including aerospace and automobile companies, could be enlisted to do so.Ventilators are basically air pumps with motors controlled by circuits that make them act like lungs: the pump pushes air into the patient, then stops so the weight of the chest can push the air back out.Automobiles and airplanes contain many small pumps, like those for oil, water and air-conditioning fluid, that might be modified to act as basic, stripped-down ventilators. On Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted that Ford and General Motors had been ""given the go-ahead"" to produce ventilators.Providers, meanwhile, are scrambling for alternatives.Canadian nurses are disseminating a 2006 paper describing how one ventilator can be modified to treat four patients simultaneously. Inventors have proposed combining C-PAP machines, which many apnea sufferers own, and oxygen tanks to improvise a ventilator.The United States must also work to increase its supply of piped and tanked oxygen, Dr. Aylward said.One of the lessons of China, he noted, was that many Covid-19 patients who would normally have been intubated and on ventilators managed to survive with oxygen alone.Retrofit hospitalsHospitals in the United States have taken some measures to handle surges of patients, such as stopping elective surgery and setting up isolation rooms.To protect bedridden long-term patients, nursing homes and hospitals also should immediately stop admitting visitors and do constant health checks on their staffs, said Dr. James LeDuc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch.The national stockpile does contain some prepackaged military field hospitals, but they are not expected to be nearly enough for a big surge.In Wuhan, the Chinese government famously built two new hospitals in two weeks. All other hospitals were divided: 48 were designated to handle 10,000 serious or critical coronavirus patients, while others were restricted to handling emergencies like heart attacks and births.Wherever that was impractical, hospitals were divided into ""clean"" and ""dirty"" zones, and the medical teams did not cross over. Walls to isolate whole wards were built, and -- as in Ebola wards -- doctors went in one end of the room wearing protective gear and left by the other end, where they de-gowned under the eyes of a nurse to prevent infection.Decide when to close schoolsAs of Saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely, but that is a decision that divided experts.""Closing all schools may not make sense unless there is documented widespread community transmission, which we're not seeing in most of the country,"" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director under President Barack Obama.It is unclear how much children spread coronavirus. They very seldom get sick enough to be hospitalized, which is not true of flu. Current testing cannot tell whether most do not even become infected.In China, Dr. Aylward said, he asked all of the doctors he spoke to whether they had seen any family clusters in which a child was the first to be infected. No one had, he said, which astonished him.That leaves a quandary. Closing schools is a normal part of social distancing; after all, schools are the workplaces for many adults, too. And when the disease is clearly spreading within an individual school, it must close.But closing whole school districts can seriously disrupt a city's ability to fight an outbreak. With their children stuck at home, nurses, doctors, police officers and other emergency medical workers cannot come to work.Also, many children in low-income families depend on the meals they eat at schools.Cities that close all schools are creating special ""hub schools"" for the children of essential workers. In Ohio, the governor has told school bus drivers to deliver hot meals to children who normally got them at school.Recruit volunteersChina's effort succeeded, experts said, in part because of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. The government declared a ""people's war"" and rolled out a ""Fight On, Wuhan! Fight On, China!"" campaign.It made inspirational films that combined airline ads with 1940s-style wartime propaganda. The ads were somewhat corny, but they rallied the public.Many people idled by the lockdowns stepped up to act as fever checkers, contact tracers, hospital construction workers, food deliverers, even babysitters for the children of first responders, or as crematory workers.With training, volunteers were able to do some ground-level but crucial medical tasks, such as basic nursing, lab technician work or making sure that hospital rooms were correctly decontaminated.Americans often step forward to help neighbors affected by hurricanes and floods; many will no doubt do so in this outbreak, but they will need training in how not to fall ill and add to the problem.""In my experience, success is dependent on how much the public is informed and participates,"" Admiral Ziemer said. ""This truly is an 'all hands on deck' situation.""Prioritize the treatmentsClinicians in China, Italy and France have thrown virtually everything they had in hospital pharmacies into the fight, and at least two possibilities have emerged that might save patients: the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral remdesivir, which has no licensed use.There is not proof yet that any of these are effective against the virus. China registered more than 200 clinical trials, including several involving those treatments, but investigators ran out of patients in critical condition to enroll. Italy and France have trials underway, and hospitals in New York are writing trial protocols now.One worry for trial leaders is that chloroquine has been given so much publicity that patients may refuse to be ""randomized"" and accept a 50 percent chance of being given a placebo.If any drug works on critical cases, it might be possible to use small doses as a prophylactic to prevent infection.An alternative is to harvest protective antibodies from the blood of people who have survived the illness, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.The purified blood serum -- called immunoglobulin -- could possibly be used in small amounts to protect emergency medical workers, too.""Unfortunately, the first wave won't benefit from this,"" Dr. Hotez said. ""We need to wait until we have enough survivors.""Find a vaccineThe ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines. But as Dr. Fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.The process will take at least a year, even if nothing goes wrong. The roadblock, vaccine experts explained, is not bureaucratic. It is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.After extensive animal testing, vaccines are normally given to about 50 healthy human volunteers to see if they cause any unexpected side effects and to measure what dose produces enough antibodies to be considered protective.If that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating. Half get the vaccine, the rest do not -- and the investigators wait. If the vaccinated half do not get the disease, the green light for production is finally given.In the past, some experimental vaccines have produced serious side effects, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can paralyze and kill. A greater danger, experts said, is that some experimental vaccines, paradoxically, cause ""immune enhancement,"" meaning they make it more likely, not less, that recipients will get a disease. That would be a disaster.One candidate coronavirus vaccine Dr. Hotez invented 10 years ago in the wake of SARS, he said, had to be abandoned when it appeared to make mice more likely to die from pneumonia when they were experimentally infected with the virus.In theory, the testing process could be sped up with ""challenge trials,"" in which healthy volunteers get the vaccine and then are deliberately infected. But that is ethically fraught when there is no cure for Covid-19. Even some healthy young people have died from this virus.Reach out to other nationsWealthy nations need to remember that, as much as they are struggling with the virus, poorer countries will have a far harder time and need help.Also, the Asian nations that have contained the virus could offer expertise -- and desperately needed equipment. Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba, recently offered large shipments of masks and testing kits to the United States.Wealthy nations ignored the daily warnings from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, that far more aggressive efforts at isolation and contact tracing were urgently needed to stop the virus.""Middle income and poorer nations are following the advice of international organizations while the most advanced nations find it so hard to implement it,"" Dr. Nabarro said. ""That must change.""In declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, Dr. Tedros called for countries to learn from one another's successes, act with unity and help protect one another against a threat to people of every nationality.""Let's all look out for each other,"" he said.PhotographThe National Guard at a drive- through test site in New Jersey.

High school senior Emma Rehac can't help but feel resentful as leaders across the country scramble to keep families afloat through mounting unemployment and an unprecedented public health crisis.
She hears politicians looking for emergency cures to problems she and other activists were talking about long before anyone had heard of covid-19: affordable housing, utility shut-offs and health-care access among them. Now Rehac, 18, is trying to get unemployment benefits after losing her part-time teaching job at a school closed during the novel coronavirus outbreak. She's part of a historic wave of layoffs, coming of age at a hot spot of the pandemic in New York City, where drastic moves to blunt the fallout seem to Rehac to be too little, too late.
""There's so much anger and frustration that these are things that have been impacting us for so long, and it took a pandemic?"" Rehac said. ""Here's all of this attention and, all of a sudden, all of these resources that everyone said didn't exist.""
Generation Z was already politically liberal, increasingly activist and fed up with the status quo. The oldest members of the generation - which includes those born from 1997 to 2012, according to the Pew Research Center - grew up amid soaring inequality and overwhelmingly backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primaries. Sanders withdrew from the presidential race Wednesday.
Now the coronavirus crisis may solidify their political identity, experts say. As the pandemic and its economic havoc exacerbate disparities, some Gen Zers see grim validation of their support for the government-run programs and social-welfare policies less popular with their parents and grandparents. Seventy percent of them believe the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 53 percent of Gen Xers and 49 percent of baby boomers, according to Pew.
Gen Z cares ""really deeply about inequalities and addressing that directly,"" said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, who directs the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. ""And that's part of the reason big government appeals to them . . . universal health care, universal income and all that. And I think this pandemic, if anything, would really kind of affirm their position.""
Images of carefree spring breakers, who traveled to beach towns last month as concerns mounted about the virus's spread, have dominated popular views of the generation. The nation erupted with fury at Miami Beach revelers who griped about bar shutdowns. They fed the worst stereotypes of young people as self-absorbed and thoughtless about the elderly - those most likely to die if they didn't help ""flatten the curve"" to slow the spread of infection so that the health-care system isn't overwhelmed.
But for another segment of the generation - which turned the trauma of school shootings and grim forecasts about the climate into millions-strong movements - the virus has energized their political activism. They see this crisis as inextricably linked to other problems that plague them and wonder whether the coronavirus pandemic could bring more people around to their calls for radical change.
As the seriousness of the crisis settled in for 17-year-old Xiye Bastida, she canceled a trip to Mexico and drew up a strict ""quarantine schedule"" for her weekdays holed up indoors, limiting herself to one hour of Netflix.
Sacrifice is a driving philosophy of Bastida's politics. The climate activist, whom news outlets have dubbed ""America's Greta Thunberg,"" has begged others to make big, uncomfortable changes to avert disaster.
""It's for the greater good,"" she says of the societal shutdown that put her senior year of high school in limbo.
She and other young activists have been using some of their time in self-quarantine to organize protests and grow the movements behind their own causes. They have incorporated the pandemic into their messaging about health care, climate change and income inequality.
Written into Bastida's Friday schedule: ""Strike for Climate and an appropriate government response to COVID-19. ""
""They will see this as a life-changing moment in many ways,"" Kawashima-Ginsberg predicted, ""whereas older adults may see this as a really major disruption in our lives, hopefully going back.""
The crisis generation
Bastida doesn't want the world to go back to normal, even as her life in New York City is upended. Yes, prom was canceled; her parents' jobs and work visas are newly uncertain; her family has fled their apartment for a friend's home in Massachusetts, worried about staying in the building where young and old share the same elevator.
But for Bastida, back to normal would mean returning to a society in which individual interest reigns and each generation fends for its own well-being.
""Emotionally, a lot of people are very unsettled . . . feeling like this is a crisis,"" Bastida said of the pandemic. ""And this is how we feel every day.""
In a Pew poll conducted in late March, the majority of adult Gen Zers said the virus is a ""major threat"" to the country's economy and the health of the population. While only 22 percent saw it as a threat to their own health, a majority believe the pandemic put their personal financial situation at risk.
Recent data from the center found workers ages 16 to 24 - half of whom work in the hard-hit service sector - will be disproportionately affected by layoffs due to the virus, although most high school and college students won't get checks from the government's massive stimulus plan. Researchers are wondering whether the coronavirus pandemic will become to Gen Z what the Great Recession was to millennials.
Millennials ""came into adulthood in a really difficult economic time, and they really struggled to get their footing,"" said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. ""We thought it was going to be different for Gen Z. But now this sort of turns that all upside down.""
Rather than be sidelined by that turmoil, many young activists are finding ways to push their political efforts forward.
Normally, Bastida would march out after AP calculus and set up at city hall for a climate change protest. But in these strange new times, it was a digital strike, with video chats and tweeted pictures of cardboard signs. Savvy with social media and already serving as tech support for work-from-home parents, Gen Z was perfectly fine moving online.
Joe Hobbs, a 17-year-old volunteer for Fridays for Future, the youth climate movement that Thunberg founded, said the pandemic has only intensified many young people's commitments to their causes.
""We're finding that across the globe, Fridays for Future activists and organizers are doing even more because they have nothing else to do,"" Hobbs said from Columbia, Md., where he's under a stay-at-home order. ""They don't have school to distract them.""
March for Our Lives, the student-led group that mobilized for gun control after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting in 2018, has been tweeting about two public health emergencies: ""Denial isn't a policy: not for #COVID19, and not for the gun violence epidemic.""
""We need our leaders to ACT to save lives,"" the group wrote. ""We need REAL policy solutions. ""
In Harlem last week, Rehac was talking about rent cancellation at a pro-Sanders town hall held by video. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has halted evictions for 90 days, but Housing Justice for All, a coalition Rehac belongs to, is pushing him to completely wipe out those months of rent. Rehac argues it's necessary as people stare down weeks and maybe months of unemployment.
She thinks the cancel-rent campaign is gaining steam. And maybe, she added, the pain of shutting down New York City could get more people to listen about the bigger ideas: more stringent rent control, more money for affordable housing.
""If we had a #HomesGuarantee millions of people wouldn't be worried about paying rent tomorrow,"" Housing Justice for All tweeted as the April 1 rent due date loomed. ""Or on May 1. Or on June 1. Imagine that.""
Other young devotees of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, also say the virus has underscored vast gaps in wealth and a broken health-care system. Voters age 24 and younger favored Sanders by huge margins in this year's Democratic primaries, with three-quarters choosing him in California and Michigan exit polling.
While their turnout lags behind their elders, Gen Z will comprise 1 in 10 eligible voters at the time of the November presidential election, according to Pew.
The coronavirus crisis ""really does expose all the inequities that people knew existed but maybe couldn't see as clearly until this point,"" said Roxie Richner. Her high school in Michigan has turned to non-graded ""enrichment"" activities, she said, unsure how to handle the fact that not everyone has laptops and Internet access.
For years, Richner has been a fervent Sanders supporter - holding a campaign kickoff party in her living room, volunteering ahead of the March 10 Michigan primary and feeling crushed when her candidate lost every county. But maybe, she thought, this moment of upheaval could shift politics in the United States for good. The senator from Vermont has been tweeting about the millions of Americans laid off with ""nothing in the bank,"" the big companies that said they couldn't afford paid sick leave, and the people who would die because they waited too long to go to the hospital, anxious about the bill.
A day after celebrating her 18th birthday on March 26 with friends over FaceTime - someone tried to light a toothpick because no one had candles - she was feeling stir-crazy and scared, but also wondering if the country might emerge from all this a bit more open to her generation's demands.
""I think it does give people some insight into what it's like experiencing a time of crisis,"" Richner said, ""and that realization that a lot of America lives in crisis mode 24/7, whether there's a pandemic or not.""
The greater good
Bastida is wondering whether the needle could move on climate change, the issue she says became personal for her when her Mexican hometown flooded. She spent the last Friday night in March tuning in from her family friends' kitchen to a ""Zoom party,"" which was really a planning meeting for the Earth Day demonstration that would now have to take place fully online.
""Every crisis needs to be treated like a crisis,"" her fellow activist Thunberg had said on a public Zoom call last month, not long before announcing she was recovering after exhibiting symptoms of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Bastida ran down to-dos with 11 high school and college students calling in from various time zones, some of them wearing pajamas. They wondered who they could get to appear in an Earth Day video. Willow and Jaden Smith? What about Miley Cyrus? TikTok star Charli D'Amelio?
Someone had reached out to about 50 social media influencers and gotten encouraging responses, although one had asked whether the video would be a ""paid gig.""
Bastida and her friends laughed: No.
Back in the city she left, her 22-year-old friend Daphne Frias is fighting the coronavirus and pneumonia, isolated in a hotel room that ambulances wail past a dozen times a day.
Immunocompromised with cerebral palsy, Frias spent so much time in hospitals growing up that she calls herself a ""professional patient."" She has gotten pneumonia in almost each of the last seven years. She didn't wait for a stay-at-home order, retreating indoors before a single case of the coronavirus was confirmed in New York.
But March 9 was a beautiful, warm day, she said, and she allowed herself a trip outside. Four days later, she was coughing and tired, then dizzy and feverish. She tested positive for the coronavirus.
Her mother and sister quarantined with her at home, donning masks and gloves to throw out the garbage. Friends dropped off groceries outside their apartment. But after making a slow recovery, Frias's fever came roaring back last week, and she decided she needed to separate from her family.
Some of Frias's health-care costs were covered, she said, but other bills - the hotel room, the medications, the four-times-a-day inhalation treatments that clear her already-weak lungs - are adding up to the point that her bank sends fraud alerts. She needs savings to move to Baltimore in a few months for graduate school, where she'll work toward a medical degree and master's in public health. While she found financial relief in a friend's GoFundMe campaign, she knows others are less fortunate.
Like Bastida, her friend and fellow activist, Frias sees an opening. The usual election-year politics seem distant to her as the ups and downs of campaigns gave way to headlines about the struggles of average Americans amid the pandemic.
""We're able to listen in a way that we haven't been able to before,"" Frias said. ""And I hope that when things go back to normal and it gets noisy again, we can remember to still listen and help people the way that we have now.""

It often feels as if the world is shrinking, that almost all of us are interconnected, our disparate cultures linked by things from Internet memes to the latest Netflix film. But in generations nothing has so bound the world together as the coronavirus pandemic. It quickly has become a common language: the fear, the helplessness, the unnerving empty streets and vacant parks and shuttered schools. Traveling by airplane and cruise ship and train, the virus ties Seoul to Tehran to Milan to Washington state, where it has spread at places of worship and conferences and offices and schools and markets. ""This is a virus that knows no borders,"" said Olaf Scholz, Germany's vice chancellor and finance minister, urging people worldwide to use it as a rallying cry. ""It actually shows that solidarity is the only way that we can move forward as human beings.""
The coronavirus has taken an outsized toll on Italy, with more than 21,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 1,400 deaths, leading to a lockdown that has left parks and public spaces empty. Every year at the end of February, an amusement park sets up in front of the Arena Civica. During its stay, the park is one of the most crowded places in Milan. It is closed to lessen the spread of the virus. Other public spaces are eerily silent, too, due to social distancing. Restrictions are imposed on 60 million people.

The first epicenter of the outbreak in the United States emerged in Kirkland, Wash., outside Seattle. A nursing home, Life Care Center, saw more than 50 of its residents and staff fall ill, and as of Saturday at least 25 had died - more than half of all U.S. deaths related to covid-19. The outbreak spurred restrictions and cancellations. Sue Heale, head of Kirkland Academy of Music and Performance, moved lessons online: ""If we had to shut down, we would go out of business in two to four weeks.""

. The cruise and travel industries have been hit hard, with residents like Gabriella Simonelli, right, executive director of Perfection Travel in Miami, saying the coronavirus implications are ominous: ""We survive through tourism."" There have been nearly 700 confirmed cases of coronavirus among cruise ship passengers and crew, and some cruise lines have suspended service during the outbreak.

Chinatown in Tokyo has been abandoned, much like other Chinatowns around the world, one example of how some stereotypes are persistent. The novel coronavirus has had a huge effect in China -with more than 80,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths - and in Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed schools for a month amid more than 700 cases. As streets lay empty in Chinatown, Japan has repeatedly insisted that postponing or canceling the Summer Olympics in Tokyo is not an option.

In late February as coronavirus infections mounted in Wuhan, China, authorities went door-to-door for health checks – forcibly isolating every resident in makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine shelters, even separating parents from children who displayed symptoms of COVID-19, no matter how seemingly mild.
Caretakers at the city's ubiquitous large apartment buildings were pressed into service as ad hoc security guards, monitoring the temperatures of all residents, deciding who could come in and implementing inspections of delivered food and medicines. 
Outside, drones hovered above streets, yelling at people to get inside and scolding them for not wearing face masks. Elsewhere in China, facial-recognition software, linked to a mandatory phone app that color-coded people based on their contagion risk, decided who could enter shopping malls, subwaysand other public spaces. 
""We couldn't go outside under any circumstances. Not even if you have a pet,"" said Wang Jingjun, 27, a graduate student who returned to Wuhan from the Chinese coastal province of Guangdong in mid-January to live with her elderly mother and grandparents. ""Those with dogs had to play with them inside and teach them to use the bathroom in a certain spot."" 
As the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic has moved to the USA, Chinese officials and public health experts insist that even if President Donald Trump were to immediately adopt all the strict testing and lockdown measures that Western scientific advisers advocate, these actions would still not be sufficient to stem the spread of a disease that is swiftly approaching a million worldwide cases. 
More severe steps are needed in the USA, these officials say, although they cast doubt on whether Americans could do what the Chinese did, for a mixture of reasons: political will and deep-rooted cultural inclinations among them. 
To help quell its outbreak, Beijing embarked on one of the largest mass mobilization efforts in history, closing all schools, forcing millions of people inside, quickly building more than a dozen vast temporary hospitals, deploying thousands of extra medical staff to Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province and meticulously testing and tracing anyone and everyone who may have encountered the virus.
It did a lot more than that. 
""Lockdowns, bans on gatherings, basic quarantines, testing, hand-washing, this is not enough,"" Huiyao Wang, a senior adviser to China's government, told USA TODAY in a phone interview from Beijing. ""You need to isolate people on an enormous scale, in stadiums, big exhibition halls, wherever you can. It seems extreme. It works. 
"" 'No one left behind' was the slogan in Wuhan,"" he said. ""No one.""
In the USA, Trump urged Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people and suggested the worst-affected states should shutter schools, bars and restaurants. 
Overall, he has left it to individual states and cities to decide whether to close businesses or explicitly order people to stay at home, despite evidence from countries in Asia, such as China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, that aggressively limiting public gatherings and social interactions can help stop transmission of COVID-19, when done in combination with extensive testing and tracing of the disease.
Trump said he expects to see U.S. cases peak ""around Easter,"" although his claims about how quickly the USA can overcome the outbreak and bounce back contradict assessments from top health officials, such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
After New York City became the new locus of the outbreak, Trump announced Sunday an extension of federal guidance on social distancing measures through April and issued a ""strong travel advisory"" urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from nonessential travel for 14 days to help limit the spread of the virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the new restrictions would help slow the spread of the respiratory illness, which has infected more than 209,000 Americans and killed more than 4,600. The daily death toll in the USA may not dip below 100 per day before June, according to a study by the University of Washington.
China's nationwide response
Wang, the Chinese government adviser, said the example of Wuhan, where authorities have started lifting some of their stringent anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months, illustrates that the USA and West more generally need to take far more radical virus-dampening actions that many people outside China might find culturally, logistically and emotionally unpalatable. 
""It was not just families being isolated together in Wuhan but individuals being isolated away from their friends and families,"" said Andy Mok, a fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a public policy think tank based in Beijing.
""China's response to the outbreak was truly a nationwide response: systematic, comprehensive and coordinated. This is why China was able to 'flatten the curve' so dramatically,"" he said, referring to social isolation measures aimed at keeping the number of coronavirus infections at a manageable level for hospitals and medical workers who would otherwise be overwhelmed with sick patients. 
Mok said that even in Beijing, about 750 miles north of Wuhan, coronavirus rules were established requiring residents to have a formal pass to get in and out of their apartment buildings and homes. At the outbreak's height in Wuhan, nobody was allowed in or out of the city, and access to food stores was limited to once every few days.
Video footage published by the Australian Broadcasting Corp., the country's state-funded broadcaster, showed Chinese authorities in Wuhan welding doors to entire apartment buildings shut – with residents inside – to enforce quarantines. The footage, collected from Chinese social media users, could not be independently verified by USA TODAY. 
Mok questioned whether Americans, raised on a diet of individualism and civil liberties that has informed every aspect of life from travel to economic institutions, would be willing to abide by invasive virus detection and containment methods that require a strong commitment to ""collectivism"" and abridged freedoms.
Europe has adopted some, but not all, of China's most restrictive steps. In France, residents must fill out of a signed attestation to justify leaving their homes or apartments. Police hand out large fines to anyone who doesn't follow the rules.
""It's a very clever form of social engineering for civic purposes: It forces you to think about and justify to yourself, as well as to the world, why you are leaving the house,"" said Sarah Maza, a French history professor and U.S. citizen living in France for the year.
Yang Junchao, a member of a Chinese delegation of COVID-19 doctors and medical experts assisting Italy in halting its coronavirus infections – the worst in Europe – said its epidemic will be controlled ""as long as the Italian public cooperates."" 
Some American public health officials have acknowledged that to bring the virus under control – outside of a vaccine breakthrough – actions that overstep the bounds of what most Americans would be comfortable with, such as mass quarantines and other severe restrictions on movement, may be necessary. 
""The approach we should be taking right now is one that most people would find to be too drastic because otherwise, it is not drastic enough,"" Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a USA TODAY interview.
""It may be a country like China has a more top-down ability to insist on certain behavior changes. But we ought to be able to do it in our way, in a bottom-up fashion,"" he said. 
'Widespread discontent'?
Trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned China's initial suppression of warnings about the outbreak and questioned the accuracy of Beijing's infection figures.
China's central government has dismissed persistent allegations that it tried to downplay the severity of infections, although it has not denied initially detaining whistleblowing doctors and citizen journalists in December who tried to speak out about the mysterious virus in Wuhan. China's National Health Commission said Tuesday it will start including asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in its daily figures. 
As of Wednesday, China recorded less than half – about 82,000 – the number of U.S. coronavirus cases. It may be bracing for a potential second wave of infections: Over the past few days, China has reclosed some public spaces and businesses, such as movie theaters, amid spiking clusters of cases, mostly imported. 
""The Chinese are trying to paint the narrative that the model they have pursued has been a huge success and that we are failing"" because of our mode of governance, J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs (CSIS), a Washington think tank, said in a media briefing. 
Morrison said there's significant evidence that the Chinese government's handling of the crisis sparked ""widespread discontent and dissatisfaction,"" pointing to the case of Dr. Li Wenliang, who was detained when he tried to alert other health care providers about the novel coronavirus. He died from the virus.
Concern has grown over the whereabouts of Ai Fen, the head of Emergency at Wuhan Central Hospital. She is the doctor who first alerted Wenliang about the spread of the virus. An Australian investigation team that interviewed Fen last week said she has disappeared, possibly detained by the Chinese government. 
Heather Conley, the director of the Europe program at CSIS, said that although the response in democratic countries may look chaotic, there's strength in that approach. ""You have neighbors helping neighbors, and you have states making decisions. Sometimes it's the federal level having to catch up with those decisions, and that's a much more dynamic, nimble and resilient response,"" she said. 
Jan Renders, 29, a graduate student who was studying Chinese politics at Central China Normal University in Wuhan and was airlifted out Feb. 1 to his home in Belgium, said the Chinese response was ""too harsh"" and lacked transparency. 
""In Wuhan, when everything went into lockdown, nobody could come or go, and that included patients. The hospitals were overloaded, and I'm sure people died because they couldn't be transported to other hospitals, where there was room,"" he said, noting that German hospitals started taking coronavirus patients from overcrowded hospitals in Italy, where more than 13,000 people have died of COVID-19, the most anywhere. 
Edward Tse, the Hong Kong-based founder of the Gao Feng Advisory Co., a management consultancy with roots in mainland China, said his perception is that, on the whole, most people in China supported the government's tough measures.
""Isolation is the key,"" he said. ""It just depends on how you do it. The Chinese government decided to do it in a certain way. It turned out to be quite effective.""
A British video blogger posted a video on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform last week that explained how China implemented the softer side of its policy of ""ling jiechu,"" which translates as ""zero contact."" It allowed neighborhood committees to take charge of arrangements for shopping and deliveries. Highways were made toll-free, with no limits to the number of cars on a road. For those without a car, customized bus routes were set up and operated according to demand. Tickets could be purchased on a smartphone app, and capacity was set at 50%. Many restaurants installed basic but effective pulley systems to maintain employee-customer distance.
Wang, the student who returned to Wuhan from Guangdong to live with her elderly relatives, said many people in China ""have the idea, and maybe it's a stereotype, that medical care"" in the USA and Europe is more advanced than in China. 
""I am worried about places like New York City and Milan,"" she said. ""I don't know why the deaths are so much higher there. I hope they will be strong and keep calm.""
Hjelmgaard reported from London, Lyman from Rome and Shesgreen from Washington.

| Jump to first hitAlthough the virus poses a heightened threat to older people, some of their middle-aged children feel they aren't taking it seriously enough.I went hoarse shouting at my mother last week.""You really got into your building elevator with someone else?""She blamed the other person for standing in the middle of the elevator; I blamed her for getting in, putting herself at risk of catching the coronavirus.By the time my 88-year-old father got to the phone, I remembered the researcher Brené Brown's theory that vulnerability opens all doors. I would move my father by sharing my deepest fear.I told him I loved him. I said the thought of losing him was devastating. I asked him, ""Dad, are you afraid?""He laughed. ""What's to be afraid of? If I get it, Sayonara!""Despite the virus's heightened risk to older people, my parents seem inexplicably casual about it.And I'm not alone. From every corner of our new virtual community, in Zoom cocktail hours, Google hangouts and private message boards, I've been hearing from fellow members of the sandwich generation fighting to persuade older loved ones to protect themselves from a potential death sentence from Covid-19.""My mother's still going to the market and post office, even though she has an aide,""' said Claire Muirhead, a writer from Los Angeles who recently recovered from Covid-19. ""She's 90. She knows how sick I was, and still, there's no stopping her. I'm beside myself.""We have good reason to worry. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eight out of 10 deaths reported in the United States have been in adults 65 years old and older.""We can't pretend this is not life or death,"" said Tara Brach, a psychologist and author of ""Radical Acceptance."" ""This is the real thing. These are beings we love, and we're scared we're going to lose them.""For some adult children, this means grappling with the anguish of not being able to see parents quarantined in nursing homes.For those whose parents live independently, it is often a challenge to get our older loved ones to take the risks as seriously as we do. I caught my father-in-law, a radiologist, on his way out to play cards with friends in Boca Raton, Fla., one day before Florida issued its stay-at-home order.""Just because they're friends doesn't mean they don't have the virus,"" I told him. He laughed and said, ""We appreciate your concern."" And then he left for his game.It turns out, according to experts, my approach was doomed to fail.""If you go in with anxiety and with the very innocent and loving intention to control, every human being on earth will push back against that,"" said the sociologist Martha Beck. ""There's something about being self-determined that is fundamental to being human.""Also at play is a high-stakes role reversal in the parent-child relationship. ""Earlier in your life, you were on the other side of this fighting-for-autonomy battle,"" said David Fish, a therapist specializing in dialectical behavioral therapy. ""Now aging parents are the ones struggling with limitations to their freedom and with others telling them what to do.""The Age Positivity EffectPart of the problem, according to Claudia Haase, a psychologist and the director of the Life-Span Development Lab at Northwestern University, is that older adults may not experience the same level of threat as younger people do.""A massive body of scientific work has documented age-related shifts in the service of making negative emotions smaller and positive emotions bigger,"" Dr. Haase says. ""Older adults are often masters in turning their attention away from information that is threatening, upsetting and negative.""The priority of older adults, Dr. Haase explains, is to make the most of their limited time on earth, and their highest value is social connection. ""For them, being home alone with just their thoughts and nowhere to go can be a frightening place.""And then there's the fact that older adults may not see themselves as, well, old. ""Older adults may not think of themselves as being at heightened risk for Covid-19 because old age carries a lot of stigma. There's a huge reluctance to view oneself in those terms.""How to Be HeardSo how do you explain your concerns to older relatives?Dr. Brach believes it begins with self-understanding. ""When you talk to them, ask yourself, what's going on for you? Once you start to name what's going on underneath under all the agitation, you get to your anticipatory grief: You don't want to lose them.""Dr. Beck recommends a simple, practical approach for coping, and managing anxiety, when older relatives don't see the risks the way you do. ""The idea is, you want to invert that -- you have to manage your own anxiety first.""She suggested being direct, providing solid reasoning and being clear about the consequences. ""You tell them why you're worried, and why you want them to do this thing,"" she said. ""It has to be rational. It can't just be because 'I know better and I say so.""'And you may have to acknowledge the worst case scenario. ""So it might be like, 'Mom, you're living in Florida, and you're going to the beach. I cannot stop you. But if you get sick, I can't come see you. And if you die, you may die alone, and I won't be there.' This may sound harsh, but it's true. Let them sit with the real possibility of what may happen.""Radical AcceptanceWhen all else fails, Dr. Brach espouses the art and power of radical acceptance, both for our loved ones and ourselves.""There has to be a letting go, because ultimately, you cannot control them,"" she said. ""They're responsible for their living and dying.""Once we understand that, Dr. Brach said, ""You say to yourself, 'I am afraid. I am helpless. I am feeling the grief of what could happen.' And this is where the real pain is. You put your hand on your heart and offer compassion to the place in yourself that is helpless and fears the loss.""The act of physically putting your hand on your heart is vital, Dr. Brach said, to coming to peace. ""There's a network of neurons in the heart area. When there's warmth and pressure on it, it actually calms the sympathetic nervous system and reduces the fear centers in the brain.""And what about those anxious, racing thoughts?""We need to remember that just because this feels like it's a catastrophe doesn't necessarily mean that it is,"" Mr. Fish said. ""What you're upset about right now is your imagination. It's not what's actually happening. Our minds are really good at anticipating consequences and making them very present for us, which is useful, except when it's not.""Julie Fingersh is a writer and regular contributor to O, The Oprah Magazine.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPH BY Lorenzo Gritti FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1119Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitI live in Manhattan. I live in the NYC Inferno.  A couple of Sundays ago was Easter. It really was even if it didn’t feel like it. St. Patrick’s Cathedral was shuttered. Restaurants were too. No Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue. Broadway was dark.  It is odd how this grand city has transformed — along with all of us New Yorkers — since the pandemic struck last month. Many streets are closed. Park Avenue’s now a pedestrian mall which allows for better social distancing if walking around. Street vendors vanished. The city’s no longer alive with traffic horns and subway trains barreling through stations. It’s just ambulance sirens now. . . and a whole lot of mourning.  Easter was sunny and felt like our first spring day. In other years, I would have enjoyed a run in Central Park. I don’t mind being buffeted by bikers or horse-drawn carriages. Seeing the sunbathers and families picnicking, playing Frisbee always makes me smile. But the Park is now personally off-limits for me. There’s no joy seeing medical tents filled with COVID-19 patients?  Coping with COVID-19 in New York City Everyone’s wearing masks now too. The stores no longer had them in inventory when I went to buy one, so I wear a bandana mask. Covering our faces for me is not a stigma, but rather a sign we all agree to protect each other in this novel reality. I was really caught off guard when my brother in Texas asked me the other day what designs my mask has. I never imagined I would ever discuss my wardrobe with my brother!  The first sentence in Book one of Lamentations is: “How lonely sits the city that was full of people!” That describes New York today to a tee, alone and beaten. Each day I do venture out, I feel the virus closing in on me. So much so, I finally sat down and honestly asked myself why in the heck did I ever want to live here.  I moved to Manhattan shortly before — yes, you guessed — Sep. 11, 2001. I was working in my office immediately adjacent to the World Trade Center on the morning of 9/11. I lived through that horror. . . and then the 2003 NYC blackout, Super Storm Sandy, and now am waking up each morning in the nation’s largest cluster of death and despair. Lucky, lucky me!  Bill Sternberg: Coronavirus furlough week diary: The path (not) taken On the other hand, I’ve been here for the Yankees last four World Series championships and the NY Giants last two Super Bowl wins. I was even in the crowd on Broadway cheering the ‘98 Yankee champs as they rode by in the Canyon of Heroes. Regardless of this invisible inhuman force driving us apart at the moment, Manhattan makes me happy.  I’m energized by the hustle & bustle of Grand Central Station. I enjoy our museums and watching the costumed characters in Times Square pose for pictures with tourists. I even enjoy Coney Island in the hot summer months — but don’t tell anyone! And still, get thrilled by the Empire State Building’s light shows celebrating holidays and events. The building right now is illuminated red each night to symbolize a heartbeat in tribute to those infected with COVID-19.  So many people say New Yorkers are just plain rude. I admit we are at times. I am. Yet I quickly learned after moving here that we are more often open-hearted and have an incredible acceptance of anyone in need, regardless of ethnicity.  I still have hope Manhattan is on pause right now. We residents probably were somewhat slow to relinquish control of our daily lives when locked down, but soon united to fight this menace. We definitely have had enough experience in disaster recovery.  I just finished rereading John Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath. In that novel, Tom Joad kept moving forward on pure hope without a dime in his pocket. No one misfortune, death, or adversity stopped him.  Coronavirus guilt: My mother is alone in a nursing home with dementia, and I can't visit The Joad family’s despondency in the 1930s is eerily similar to our frustration today. Steinbeck describes best the unbelievable Joad hope which helped the family move forward each day in this conversation near the end of the book: “Seems like our life’s over and done. What’s to keep everything from stopping; all the folks from just gitting tired and laying down?” “Hard to say, everything we do — seems to me is aimed right at going on. Seems that way to me. Even getting hungry — even being sick, some die, but the rest is tougher. ” Hotline: Share your coronavirus story New York City currently has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any other US city, including more than 11,000 deaths. I wish I wasn’t living in this Inferno, but I still have hope. Our Resurrection Day was just delayed. Our future new normal may be far off, but when it comes, I will be living right here in Manhattan.

| Jump to first hitSteven admits he still gets cravings. He only recently weaned himself off of the Suboxone he was prescribed to treat his opioid addiction.  The 41-year-old from Milwaukee, who declined to provide his last name because of the stigma that comes with addiction, has been clean from heroin for six months and completely sober for three months.  But the coronavirus has presented new challenges that have disrupted his daily routine and contributed to mounting stress and anxiety.  “It’s difficult to get yourself out of this mindset of thinking the world is going to hell, and I might as well use to make myself feel good,” he said.  Steven and others recovering from substance use disorders are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, medical and treatment experts say. They may be unable to get necessary prescriptions and treatments vital to their recovery. They're already more at risk for homelessness, and if they get the disease that means they may be more likely to need hospitalization or be more prone to severe symptoms.  “We keep talking about elderly individuals or individuals with preexisting conditions. What we’re learning from scientists is that substance use disorder is itself an underlying condition"" for the coronavirus, said Jessica Hulsey Nickel, founder of the Addiction Policy Forum.  Already she said she's receiving reports of relapses in the network. Offices used for 12-step meetings have been closed due to state-mandated stay-at-home orders.  Some people are hesitant to attend meetings online after they were hacked by ""Zoombombers,"" threatening participants' anonymity and taunting their disease. Others have resorted to the less personal but more secure option of teleconferences.  Those who require medication to treat their addiction, such as Suboxone or methadone, find it harder to get their prescriptions in the inundated health care system, treatment experts say. And inpatient treatment centers struggle to cater to their patients while following social distancing guidelines.  Those who relapse, Nickel said, put themselves at risk for job and food insecurity, as well as homelessness. Members of the homeless community infected by COVID-19 are twice as likely to be hospitalized and two to three times as likely to die as the general population, according to a new data-driven analysis from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA and Boston University.  When will life return to normal? Expert says US testing is too far behind to know, expects second wave of cases In New York state: Black and Hispanic populations are at higher risk of dying from coronavirus, data shows Substance users who contract the virus face greater dangers than the general population, experts say.  Just as people who have opioid use disorders are more likely to die of an overdose if they have a chronic respiratory disease, lung damage from COVID-19 could pose the same risk, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  Methamphetamines could also contribute to lung damage and pulmonary hypertension because they constrict the blood vessels.  “The same advice we’re giving to our cancer and diabetes patients needs to be relayed to those who have an opioid or meth disorder,” Nickel said.  Substance use disorders are also known to be strongly associated with smoking or vaping, which harm lung health and increase the risk that a person with COVID-19 develops severe illnesses.  A majority of people who battle with a substance use disorder continue to smoke cigarettes, even years into their recovery, said Dr. Jeffrey Samet, chief and chair of general internal medicine at Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine. ""And we do know that COVID is more complicated among those with tobacco-use histories. "" People who smoke were 2. 4 times more likely to have severe symptoms from COVID-19 compared with those who didn't smoke, according to a study published in February by the New England Journal of Medicine.  And for those practicing social distancing or are alone because of stay-at-home orders, the risk of overdosing is increased with no one around to call emergency services or administer naloxone, commonly known by its brand name Narcan.  So how do we protect those who are not only at risk for contracting the virus, but also vulnerable to severe complications?  Steven says he helps himself by sticking to a routine, being active outside and taking his recovery one day at a time, similar to what he did before the outbreak.  Nickel says the Addiction Policy Forum is reaching out to patients to educate them about the virus. She recommends enlisting the help of family and friends, whether you're recovering from a substance use disorder or actively using.  ""In general, there's so much stigma around addiction and the stigma that our patients face on a day-to-day basis is heartbreaking,"" Nickel said. ""And right now in the middle of this crisis we need to make sure our patients get the most care. "" Tips for those in recovery during the coronavirus pandemic The Addiction Policy Forum recommends the following tips for those who are in recovery:  Seek recovery support online including your addiction health care provider, 12 step meetings and other key programs.  Stay connected to your health care and addiction provider to take and refill medications. Ask about virtual options appointments.  For people with an active substance use disorder: Do not share supplies including injecting supplies, pipes, vapes, bongs, straws or glasses.  Despite social distancing requirements, do not use opioids alone especially if injecting fentanyl or heroin. If alone, call or video chat a friend.  Consider stocking up on naloxone to have on hand and ensure loved ones have access as well.  Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.

| Jump to first hitSubmicroscopic infectious agents have a way of revealing the worst in us, and the best. That is the story of the AIDS epidemic generally, and in particular of ACT UP -- the 33-year-old radical direct-action group formally and loftily called the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. For nearly a decade in the 1980s and 1990s, ACT UP was a ubiquitous and unnerving presence, not only in America but in 19 countries worldwide. At its peak, it claimed 148 chapters, and though its ranks remained relatively small -- numbering perhaps no more than 10,000 -- it terrified and angered much of the population, whether by halting rush-hour traffic and taking over public spaces with ""die-ins"" and ""kiss-ins,"" at which members laid on the ground or made out with one another, or by disrupting scientific conferences and political affairs with foghorns, fake blood and smoke bombs (even, in one instance, overturning banquet tables).Generally, the news media didn't think much of their work, branding the group both vulgar and counterproductive. ""Far from inspiring sympathy,"" The New York Times said of ACT UP in 1989, their methods were ""another reason to reject both the offensive protesters and their ideas."" Coverage wasn't much warmer in some gay newspapers, which were owned by older and more conservative types who saw them as churlish mobsters, spoiled and rude. ACT UP didn't entirely disagree. They were, as their motto goes, ""united in anger.""And there was much to be angry about. It's hard to remember now how criminally inept the establishment's reaction was to a disease that disproportionately affected gay men. It took four years after the virus's discovery for President Ronald Reagan even to mention AIDS in public, in 1985, and almost 600 American deaths for The Times to give it a front-page headline. Congress, barely acknowledging the problem, attached anti-queer provisions to public health budgets while some states considered proposals to quarantine those who were H.I.V. positive. It's also hard to remember that on the night ACT UP was founded, in 1987 -- six years into the epidemic and 15,000 American deaths later -- there was still not a single pill on the market to prescribe. It sure seemed likely that every gay man would perish without a tear from the rest of the world.At least that was the nightmare scenario of the playwright Larry Kramer. In New York in those days, Kramer had a certain reputation for screaming about AIDS when everyone else was crying about it. While so many of us were caring for the dying and mourning the dead, he ranted at the White House and City Hall and lashed out at his beloved gay community, whose members he denounced as useless ""sissies"" incapable of fighting for our own survival. His fury did little to galvanize people behind him. Instead, it got him removed from the board of Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS services agency he'd co-founded in 1982, and frozen out of gay society. But it wasn't long before more people were ready to listen to him: By the time he was asked to give a talk at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in 1987 -- he was a substitute that night; Nora Ephron had canceled -- the virus had found a second generation. These younger queers, many of them in their 20s, had a certain feeling of entitlement that eluded people who'd come of age before Stonewall, and they were furious -- shocked, even -- to realize how the health establishment had forsaken them.In New York City, their weekly meetings quickly became the epicenter for all information about the disease, the World Wide Web for rumors and facts about new drug compounds and warnings about political perils, the text thread for strategizing our collective survival. Doctors and researchers from neighborhood hospitals made sojourns to ACT UP's run-down meeting hall at the center on West 13th Street with news from the front. Elected officials and community organizers market-tested new policies there. And ordinary people -- mostly white gay men at first, but always alongside a strong contingent of lesbians and people of color -- came looking for ways to respond. They soon diversified as their numbers grew, from 50 to 350 to 800 and more.They had little in common beyond what political scientists call a linked fate: Everyone in those meetings knew someone who was dying or had died, or else they were marked for death themselves. This brought a ferocious urgency into the room. With no formal leadership (unlike many civil rights movements that came before, but much like most of today's protest groups), ACT UP was the kind of chaotic public square that Hollywood screenwriters might dream up, an unruly Athenian democracy where ideas were aired and debated and where people thought -- and screamed, and cried -- out loud. It was where anger was converted to action. Protests were planned for nearly every week, against targets ranging from City Hall to Wall Street, hospitals to homeless shelters. Brandishing instantly iconic banners and posters -- like the arresting one-sheet that warned that ""Silence = Death"" -- the group's members took over evening news broadcasts and shut down Grand Central Terminal and St. Patrick's Cathedral in highly photographed interventions that proved the effectiveness of their methods and their design-driven messaging. Not even Cosmopolitan magazine was spared, not even the Mets (the former for telling young women they weren't at risk, and the latter more opportunistically: showing up at the stadium got their point -- ""Men, Use Condoms or Beat It!"" -- on national television). ACT UP was a place to find a sense of empowerment, if not always power itself. ▶Despite these mutinous mobilizations, little changed in those first years. Just one pill materialized -- called AZT and released in 1987, it was the most expensive medication ever marketed -- but it did nothing to extend life. Congressional spending was woefully inadequate. Pharmaceutical companies lacked the necessary urgency. The nation's leading Catholic cardinal still inveighed against condom use and gay rights. Televangelists still welcomed our deaths.In the face of frustration, ACT UP pivoted brilliantly. Instead of demanding action from others, they took on the work themselves. Breaking down the myriad problems inhibiting the response to AIDS, the group spun off into committees to address them one by one: a women's committee, because women were excluded from drug trials and disease statistics; a needle-exchange committee, because no one else was trying to prevent the spread of disease among IV-drug users; a committee concentrated on minorities, because cases were growing in those communities; a housing committee, because so many lost their homes after lengthy hospitalizations; even a science committee, because the labyrinthine research institutions lacked a cogent agenda. Each group functioned autonomously, but all were bound together by ACT UP's belief that, through deep self-study, its members could bring the pandemic under control.And that is indeed what they did. Members went on to write (and help push through) legislation redirecting federal funding, change the ways insurance companies function and build housing for the homeless. Eventually, ACT UP and its spinoffs proved to be full partners in bringing effective antiretroviral drugs to market in 1996. Along the way, they revolutionized how pharmaceutical sciences are practiced and health care is provided. Today, patients of most diagnoses are involved in research through formal advisory boards, a legacy of ACT UP's citizen-science activism. Roughly 23 million people are alive today thanks to the drugs that members helped pioneer; few human beings can claim such a massive humanitarian impact. They did this not by being nice -- oh, they were never nice -- but by being right. And by helping their adversaries find their way as well. Many people the organization targeted because of their inaction, from Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health (now back in the news, with COVID-19) to politicians like Jesse Helms and drug companies like Merck & Co., had an eventual change of heart. Even President Reagan came around, though tepidly, and not until he was long out of power and more than 90,000 Americans had already died.In the meantime, ACT UP had also turbocharged the L.G.B.T.Q. movement in ways that no one dreamed possible, fueling one of the fastest social transformations in human history. When the group began, homosexuality was illegal in half of U.S. states and much of the world. Today, marriage equality is legal in 28 countries. ""We saw there was a degree of possibility in life that we didn't expect as a community of queers,"" says the New York artist Robert Vazquez-Pacheco, who attended his first ACT UP meeting in 1988. ""We saw that things could change.""What lessons can these alumni, most now in their senior years, pass along to people craving change today? For starters, please remain calm. (Coincidentally, ""Please Remain Calm"" is the title of early member Peter Staley's upcoming memoir.) In a piece of good timing, new books are impending from several ACT UP veterans, including Garance Franke-Ruta, Mark Harrington, Sarah Schulman and Ron Goldberg, who was responsible for ACT UP's most memorable protest chants. Inside the chaos of this mass-death experience, people found that being a part of a group steadied their minds. ""ACT UP didn't just save lives of people with H.I.V., to the extent that it did that,"" says Franke-Ruta, who joined ACT UP in 1988 and is now a political journalist. ""It also saved a lot of other people who otherwise would have been overwhelmed by the times.""It wasn't always easy to keep levelheaded in ACT UP meetings, which could devolve into fractious infighting and bitter turf wars. But for eight years, the group's members managed to come together again and again, keeping a steady focus on the plague. It's worth noting that ACT UP never did stop meeting. Though only a handful of chapters remain active, the core New York group still gathers every Monday night in the same West Village space, now glamorously renovated. And many original members continue to fight AIDS in numerous related ways -- as leaders of powerful agencies like amfAR, Housing Works and Treatment Action Group -- and even unrelated ones: Sean Strub, who went on to found POZ magazine in 1994 and publish his own book, ""Body Counts: A Memoir of Politics, Sex, AIDS and Survival,"" in 2014, now battles AIDS stigma as the mayor of Milford, Pa. Their work is not over.Which leads to a second lesson: Be patient. And to a third: Don't be intimidated by experts; anybody can become an expert. These principles have certainly influenced the Black Lives Matter movement, which has continued to evolve since 2013. Like ACT UP, it brings together people tackling a waterfront of disparate issues: everything from voting rights to gender justice, health care, decarceration and immigration, says the Columbia law professor Kendall Thomas, whose ACT UP bona fides date to 1987. ""The movement for black lives would look very different if its thought leaders -- many of whom are self-identified black queer people -- hadn't been able to draw on the example of ACT UP,"" he says. ""Black activists and their allies now understand that the struggle for black freedom has to make connections across many different constituencies and concerns that used to be seen as different and disconnected.""You can find ACT UP's DNA in other contemporary movements as well. The ill-fated Occupy Wall Street protests that began in 2011 have regrown into an array of splinter groups battling income inequality, student debt, the gun lobby and climate change. How much does the ""Greta Thunberg effect"" owe to ACT UP in its success in launching a global student movement to fight carbon-dioxide emissions? Like their forebears, Thunberg and her followers -- mostly teenagers -- know the scientific literature thoroughly, leaving detractors little to attack them with besides ad hominems.Add to ACT UP's offspring the gun-control activists whose numbers grew following the Parkland massacre in 2018, the growing global movement to end transgender murders, the Women's Marchers and even those working independently across nations to develop safety strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Progressive activism owes a debt to these survivors of the AIDS crisis, these stalwarts from ACT UP, for their legacy has left us all better equipped to ""challenge and reconfigure"" power imbalances, as Thomas sees it. ""We have this archive of a political practice that is available to everybody."" ACT UP's veterans, aging as they may be, aren't yet finished unleashing power.

| Jump to first hitAs of midday Thursday, 90% of the nation — that’s roughly 300 million citizens — was under either a state- or city-mandated shelter-in-place order in an effort to halt the spread of novel coronavirus.  So what’s life like for the other 10%? Are some Americans still chatting at the local barbershop, meeting for post-work happy hours and gathering for backyard barbecues? Not so much. The reality is a complicated and even conflicted mix of respect for a deadly pathogen, concern over its economic implications, and a desire to maintain a sense of American independence in the face of a collective tragedy.  Many people are no longer shaking hands or crowding into stores, but they are still going shopping, buying cars and some are even heading out to work each day.  “We’re doing what we would do for the flu, with older people sheltering in place and the rest of us taking the best care we can,” says Brian Joens, whose Iowa City eatery, Joensy’s, is doing a brisk take-out business of its fabled pork tenderloin.  “But let’s be honest, what country do we live in?” says Joens. “It’s the USA, which is freedom, freedom to choose. When we get notes from the government saying do this or do that, it feels like that’s not what this country is built on. People should be smart, and you live with your choices. ” Iowa and four other states — North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Arkansas — as yet have no state-wide orders. Seven states — Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Alabama and South Carolina — have at least one city with shelter-in-place rules. As of now, 38 states have full lock-down orders from the top.  Initial skepticism about whether social distancing orders are needed to combat the virus is fading fast. On Wednesday, 80% of Americans were under a full or partial lockdown. By Thursday, the figure grew to 90% after Florida and Georgia added state mandates.  USA TODAY reached out to residents in eight states without specific lockdown orders to get a sense of how people are confronting the growing coronavirus outbreak.  In every case, there was a clear understanding of the lethal nature of COVID-19, which to date has infected nearly 230,000 Americans and killed 5,648, from hero physicians to celebrated artists such as jazz patriarch Ellis Marsalis.  But many also were uneasy with state-ordered health directives, arguing that residents should make smart decisions for themselves. And some blamed the media for overplaying a pandemic that is expected to threaten lives across the globe for much of 2020.  “I’m looking out the window of my dealership, and people are everywhere, it’s unbelievable,” says Chris Mayes, who owns Big Red Kia and Oklahoma Motorcars along the Mile of Cars commercial strip in Norman. “We’re not on lockdown here. ” At his Big Red Kia, which remains open, Mayes makes sure salespeople stay six feet away from customers. With nearly 900 positive virus cases, and 34 deaths, Oklahoma’s numbers are not among the worst in the nation. But Mayes is worried those statistics will cause some to be complacent.  “When I see images from other U. S. cities, where there’s just no one in the streets, very few cars out, that is the total opposite of what we’re seeing here,” he says, adding that he rarely strays from his showroom. “And I’m absolutely worried about it. ” In some states, residents predict coronavirus 'will blow over' Over in the northwestern corner of Alabama near the Tennessee border, Andrew Sorrell says the streets of Florence are shockingly busy. He attributes that to a mix of optimism and fierce individualism. Still, he says, residents have stopped greeting each other without a handshake or hug for the time being.  “I think most people expect this will blow over, although when it does it will have implications we don’t understand yet,” says Sorrell, a Republican state representative out of Muscle Shoals and the co-owner of Gold, Guns and Guitars, two pawn shops doing a huge business in gun sales. “When will we shake hands again?” Sorrell says that despite having no state-wide order to stay home, many of his constituents are doing just that, especially the elderly. His own parents declined to invite his in-laws over to live-stream a church service the other day.  But others, he says, claim the dangers are being hyped by the media. He himself isn’t for a state-wide mandate but rather more personal responsibility.  “I have liberty concerns with a shelter in place order,” Sorrell says. “People just need to be more responsible for themselves with what they’re doing, where they’re going. ” For some who live in states with no gubernatorial edict on COVID-19 behavior, the anger isn’t toward a government institution that might curtail their rights but rather at the virus itself.  “I want to be safe but I don’t like the virus dictating what I can and can’t do,” says Tessa Moberg, who runs Wolf Pup Daycare in Watford City, a small town of 6,500 in the western, oil-field-rich part of North Dakota. The state so far has 150 or so coronavirus cases and three deaths.  Normally, Moberg’s business oversees more than 200 children; currently, her skeleton staff is looking after nine, mostly the kids of essential workers who still head to their jobs. While she has fears about the virus, she also claims her immune system is “through the roof” after years of working with young children.  Moberg says she cut back her staff ""with my heels dug in deep, and though I miss those kids so much I do understand what’s going on even if I don’t like it. "" Moberg admits that when she goes out to shop “it’s just weird now, you don’t want to talk or even breathe, even if it’s desolate out here. ”  In the arid, rock- and mountain-studded state of Utah, which has only 37 people per square mile, the state’s patchwork array of orders is the result of a range of factors, including a Western rugged individualist mentality and many isolated rural counties, residents say.  Instead of issuing a state-wide COVID-19 order to shelter in place, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert last week urged citizens to “Stay Safe, Stay Home,” and offered guidance on closing public facilities and restricting food service businesses to take-out only.  So far, of the 13 state health departments that oversee Utah’s 29 counties, only three have urged their counties to go beyond the governor’s broad directives, says Cameron Diehl, executive director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, which represents 249 Utah cities.  “Everyone sees what’s happening out there in the world, but how you respond really depends on where you live,” says Diehl, noting the inherent differences between Utah tourist meccas such as the Summit County ski areas and Moab mountain biking region, and far more sparsely inhabited parts of the state. ""Everyone seems to take a look at their own situation when it comes to health care, and makes a decision. "" Local leaders take some precautions to stop coronavirus outbreak Gail Terry lives in the classically rural frontier town of Cody, just east of Wyoming’s Yellowstone National Park and named after Western icon Buffalo Bill Cody.  Terry says that while only the tourism destination city of Jackson is under self-quarantine, people in Cody are taking coronavirus very seriously. Those who sell food limit the number of people coming in to shop, deliveries have stepped up, and cash donations to the local food bank she helps oversee, the Cody Cupboard, have increased as food has become more scarce.  “The data looks good for us right now,” says Terry, noting that there are 150 COVID-19 cases in the state and only one in her county. “We will keep doing what we need to on our own. But if the governor asked every one of us to shelter in place, I think people would. We watch the news, we see what’s going on. ” Many say regional reactions to COVID-19 have a lot to do with everything from the varied political views that exist across the nation to the hardships that some encounter annually because of geography.  ""We are in tornado alley, so you can have a beautiful day and then a terrible storm, so we’re used to that for Arkansans,"" says Meg Matthews, deputy chief of communications for the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. ""We’re a sturdy group of people, we take situation and make the best of it. "" Matthews says that although there is no state-wide order to stay home, various departments are taking action as needed. State parks had started to see an influx of visitors from locals and those outside the state in the past week, leading to a few exceedingly crowded trails, which has since been closed.  ""The feeling I get from most people is that we’re about a 6 out of 10 if a 10 is totally freaking out,"" says Matthews, whose state has more than 500 cases and eight deaths. ""We are all taking precautions and being practical. "" In American lore, there are perhaps few states with as fierce an independent streak as the Lone Star State of Texas. Born out of a history filled with clashes with other nations, indigenous peoples and each other, many Texans epitomize a do-it-yourself ethic that is a key ingredient in the American mythos.  Penny McBride was born and raised in the Texas Hill county town of Fredericksburg, which was settled 174 years ago by German immigrants who named it after Prince Frederick of Prussia.  There has so far been a conflicted response to coronavirus in a state that has no government mandate to shelter in place.  McBride, who runs the local chamber of commerce, says that while many businesses in the area are closed, including the Hill Country’s tourist-draw wineries, some retailers were eager to stay open while following health official recommendations for keeping customers apart and shelves sanitized.  “As the chamber, that’s made us the enforcement agency, so we’re working with different agencies now to understand some clarity,” she says, adding that a request recently made by the local hospital, Hill Country Memorial, for a shelter-in-place order for Gillespie County has so far not been acted on.  “There are 900 members of the chamber of commerce, and commerce means business, I understand that,” she says. “But if we crater our health care system, that’s an impact we just can’t take. ” McBride remains confident that despite continued debates over how to best tackle a crisis no one could anticipate, her fellow Texans’ will do the right thing even if government decrees aren’t issued.  “All the stereotypes are true, we are very independent people who like to think of ourselves as always doing things our own way,” says McBride. “But those German roots also mean we are tight-knit. So there’s the Texas maverick side, but also a part of us that will absolutely step up to take care of our own. ” Follow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'This will blow over': In states without stay-at-home orders, Americans celebrate freedom as death toll climbsWord count: 1869Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitIn late February as coronavirus infections mounted in Wuhan, China, authorities went door-to-door for health checks – forcibly isolating every resident in makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine shelters, even separating parents from young children who displayed symptoms of COVID-19, no matter how seemingly mild.  Caretakers at the city's ubiquitous large apartment buildings were pressed into service as ad hoc security guards, monitoring the temperatures of all residents, deciding who could come in and implementing inspections of delivered food and medicines.  Outside, drones hovered above streets, yelling at people to get inside and scolding them for not wearing face masks, while elsewhere in China facial-recognition software, linked to a mandatory phone app that color-coded people based on their contagion risk, decided who could enter shopping malls, subways, cafes and other public spaces.  Daily coronavirus updates: First thing in the morning to your inbox. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing here.  ""We couldn't go outside under any circumstances. Not even if you have a pet,"" said Wang Jingjun, 27, a graduate student who returned to Wuhan from the Chinese coastal province of Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong and Macau, in mid-January to live with her elderly mother and grandparents. ""Those with dogs had to play with them inside and teach them to use the bathroom in a certain spot. ""  China’s zero contact: ‘It seems extreme. It works’ As the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic has moved to the USA, Chinese officials and public health experts insist that even if President Donald Trump were to immediately adopt all the strict testing and lockdown measures that Western scientific advisers advocate, these actions would still not be sufficient to stem the spread of a disease that is swiftly approaching a million worldwide cases.  Mike Pompeo: Americans abroad wanting to return home should 'do so immediately' More severe steps are needed in the USA, these officials say, although they cast doubt on whether Americans could do what the Chinese did, for a mixture of reasons: political will and deep-rooted cultural inclinations among them.  To help quell its outbreak, Beijing embarked on one of the largest mass mobilization efforts in history, closing all schools, forcing millions of people inside, quickly building more than a dozen vast temporary hospitals, deploying thousands of extra medical staff to Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province and meticulously testing and tracing anyone and everyone who may have encountered the virus.  It did a lot more than that.  ""Lockdowns, bans on gatherings, basic quarantines, testing, hand-washing, this is not enough,"" Huiyao Wang, a senior adviser to China's government, told USA TODAY in a phone interview from Beijing. ""You need to isolate people on an enormous scale, in stadiums, big exhibition halls, wherever you can. It seems extreme. It works.  "" 'No one left behind' was the slogan in Wuhan,"" he said. ""No one. "" In the USA, Trump urged Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people and suggested the worst-affected states should shutter schools, bars and restaurants.  Overall, he has left it to individual states and cities to decide whether to close businesses or explicitly order people to stay at home, despite evidence from countries in Asia, such as China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, that aggressively limiting public gatherings and social interactions can help stop transmission of COVID-19, when done in combination with extensive testing and tracing of the disease.  Fact check: Can Trump use the Stafford Act to order a mandatory 2-week quarantine? Trump said he expects to see U. S. cases peak ""around Easter,"" although his claims about how quickly the USA can overcome the outbreak and bounce back contradict assessments from top health officials, such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Fact check: Study projects coronavirus peak, then moves the dates After New York City became the new locus of the outbreak, Trump announced Sunday an extension of federal guidance on social distancing measures through April and issued a ""strong travel advisory"" urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from nonessential travel for 14 days to help limit the spread of the virus.  The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the new restrictions would help slow the spread of the respiratory illness, which has infected more than 190,000 Americans and killed more than 4,000. The daily death toll in the USA may not dip below 100 per day before June, according to a study by the University of Washington.  Africa's paradox: It may be the worst and best place to ride out coronavirus China’s nationwide response vs. America’s patchwork Wang, the Chinese government adviser, said the example of Wuhan, where authorities have started lifting some of their stringent anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months, illustrates that the USA and West more generally need to take far more radical virus-dampening actions that many people outside China might find culturally, logistically and emotionally unpalatable.  ""It was not just families being isolated together in Wuhan but individuals being isolated away from their friends and families,"" said Andy Mok, a fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a public policy think tank based in Beijing.  ""China's response to the outbreak was truly a nationwide response: systematic, comprehensive and coordinated. This is why China was able to 'flatten the curve' so dramatically,"" he said, referring to social isolation measures aimed at keeping the number of coronavirus infections at a manageable level for hospitals and medical workers who would otherwise be overwhelmed with sick patients.  Poorest will suffer: Safety net health clinics cut services amid coronavirus epidemic Mok said that even in Beijing, about 750 miles north of Wuhan, coronavirus rules were established requiring residents to have a formal pass to get in and out of their apartment buildings and homes. At the outbreak's height in Wuhan, nobody was allowed in or out of the city, and access to food stores was limited to once every few days.  Video footage published by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. , the country's state-funded broadcaster, showed Chinese authorities in Wuhan welding doors to entire apartment buildings shut – with residents inside – to enforce quarantines. The footage, collected from Chinese social media users, could not be independently verified by USA TODAY.  Mok questioned whether Americans, raised on a diet of individualism and civil liberties that has informed every aspect of life from travel to economic institutions, would be willing to abide by invasive virus detection and containment methods that require a strong commitment to ""collectivism"" and abridged freedoms.  Global action: Great Recession showed nations can’t fight coronavirus crisis alone Europe has adopted some, but not all, of China’s most restrictive steps. In France, residents must fill out of a signed attestation to justify leaving their homes or apartments. Police hand out large fines to anyone who doesn’t follow the rules.  ""It's a very clever form of social engineering for civic purposes: It forces you to think about and justify to yourself, as well as to the world, why you are leaving the house,"" said Sarah Maza, a French history professor and U. S. citizen living in France for the year.  Yang Junchao, a member of a Chinese delegation of COVID-19 doctors and medical experts assisting Italy in halting its coronavirus infections – the worst in Europe – said its epidemic will be controlled ""as long as the Italian public cooperates. ""  Some American public health officials have acknowledged that to bring the virus under control – outside of a vaccine breakthrough – actions that overstep the bounds of what most Americans would be comfortable with, such as mass quarantines and other severe restrictions on movement, may be necessary.  ""The approach we should be taking right now is one that most people would find to be too drastic because otherwise, it is not drastic enough,"" Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a USA TODAY interview.  ""It may be a country like China has a more top-down ability to insist on certain behavior changes. But we ought to be able to do it in our way, in a bottom-up fashion,"" he said.  NIH chief Francis Collins on COVID-19: Q&A with top U. S. health official ‘Widespread discontent and dissatisfaction’ in China? Though China's official figures show that transmission of the coronavirus has all but ended in most of the country's regions, unverified reports and online photos circulate suggesting that China's death toll, primarily in Wuhan, could be far higher than the 3,312 figure published by China's National Health Commission.  The Beijing-based Caixin newspaper reported March 27 significantly elevated official cremation rates in Wuhan, possibly indicating a more substantial death figure, though the report acknowledges the increases were inconclusive. It is not clear how extensively China has counted asymptomatic cases, though it is tracking them.  Trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned China's initial suppression of warnings about the outbreak and questioned the accuracy of Beijing's infection figures.  Trump: Impeachment 'probably' distracted him from fighting coronavirus China's central government has dismissed persistent allegations that it tried to downplay the severity of infections, although it has not denied initially detaining whistleblowing doctors and citizen journalists in December who tried to speak out about the mysterious virus in Wuhan. China's National Health Commission said Tuesday it will start including asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in its daily figures.  As of Wednesday, China recorded less than half – about 82,000 – the number of U. S. coronavirus cases. It may be bracing for a potential second wave of infections: Over the past few days, China has reclosed some public spaces and businesses, such as movie theaters, amid spiking clusters of cases, mostly imported.  ""The Chinese are trying to paint the narrative that the model they have pursued has been a huge success and that we are failing"" because of our mode of governance, J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs (CSIS), a Washington think tank, said in a media briefing.  Morrison said there's significant evidence that the Chinese government’s handling of the crisis sparked ""widespread discontent and dissatisfaction,"" pointing to the case of Dr. Li Wenliang, who was detained when he tried to alert other health care providers about the novel coronavirus. He died from the virus.  Concern has grown over the whereabouts of Ai Fen, the head of Emergency at Wuhan Central Hospital. She is the doctor who first alerted Wenliang about the spread of the virus. An Australian investigation team that interviewed Fen last week said she has disappeared, possibly detained by the Chinese government.  Chinese doctor censured: His crime? Warning about the novel coronavirus Heather Conley, the director of the Europe program at CSIS, said that although the response in democratic countries such as the USA may look chaotic, there’s strength in that approach. ""You have neighbors helping neighbors, and you have states making decisions. Sometimes it’s the federal level having to catch up with those decisions, and that’s a much more dynamic, nimble and resilient response,"" she said.  PPE: Types of personal protective equipment used to combat COVID-19 Jan Renders, 29, a graduate student who was studying Chinese politics at Central China Normal University in Wuhan and was airlifted out Feb. 1 to his home in Belgium, said the Chinese response was ""too harsh"" and lacked transparency.  ""In Wuhan, when everything went into lockdown, nobody could come or go, and that included patients. The hospitals were overloaded, and I’m sure people died because they couldn’t be transported to other hospitals, where there was room,"" he said, noting that German hospitals started taking coronavirus patients from overcrowded hospitals in Italy, where more than 12,400 people have died of COVID-19, the most anywhere.  COVID-19: These countries are doing the best and worst jobs fighting coronavirus Edward Tse, the Hong Kong-based founder of the Gao Feng Advisory Co. , a management consultancy with roots in mainland China, said his perception is that, on the whole, most people in China supported the government's tough measures, including systematically isolating and quarantining carriers of the virus, even if they were from the same family or had a very mild or only suspected coronavirus infection.  ""Isolation is the key,"" he said. ""It just depends on how you do it. The Chinese government decided to do it in a certain way. It turned out to be quite effective. "" A British video blogger posted a video on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform last week that explained how China implemented the softer side of its policy of ""ling jiechu,"" which translates as ""zero contact. "" It allowed neighborhood committees to take charge of arrangements for shopping and deliveries. Highways were made toll-free, with no limits to the number of cars on a road. For those without a car, customized bus routes were set up and operated according to demand. Tickets could be purchased on a smartphone app, and capacity was set at 50%. Many restaurants installed basic but effective pulley systems to maintain employee-customer distance.  Wang, the student who returned to Wuhan from Guangdong to live with her elderly relatives, said many people in China ""have the idea, and maybe it’s a stereotype, that medical care"" in the USA and Europe is more advanced than in China.  ""I am worried about places like New York City and Milan,"" she said. ""I don’t know why the deaths are so much higher there. I hope they will be strong and keep calm.

The text arrived on a Friday night, March 6, just as I was heading to a comedy show in New York City.
""Don't go,"" my daughter texted. ""The CDC says the elderly need to stay home.""
""That's 60,"" she added, in the next text.
My daughter, meanwhile, at age 26, was heading out to a movie, with very little concern about her personal risk from the coronavirus.
I took my coat off. We may be in the midst of global health crisis, a crashing stock market and a political crisis, but I was momentarily focused on just one question:
At 64, am I really elderly?
I have completed 40 triathlons in the past seven years and I qualified for the ITU Multisport Championships this September in the Netherlands. (Although, as I fell back into the couch, I considered the treatment I had just had for arthritis in both knees.)
Like most baby boomers, a generation devoted to wellness and working out, I have been operating under the assumption that 60 is the new 40.
Suddenly, 60 is apparently the new 80.
We're elderly and our millennial and Gen X children are worried about us. They're suddenly calling, emailing and texting, ordering us to stay inside, while many of them have been feeling less at risk.
Of course, this all seems to be changing daily with repeated warnings from health officials, but a generational divide remains.
Consider Twitter, where some millennials have made fun of boomers stocking up on toilet paper and hand sanitizer while boasting of their own bargain airline ticket prices.
Most of the younger generations aren't gloating about their lower risk category, they are just worried about their suddenly frail, elderly parents in their 60s. Trish Hall, 69, an editor and author, said her daughter texted last week wanting to know:
""What is your coronavirus plan?""
She didn't have one yet.
Naturally, some boomer parents are bristling a bit, despite all of the expressions of love and concern. They are bristling both at the idea that they are elderly and at the fact their offspring are suddenly telling them what to do.
Winter Hoffman, 63, and her husband, Fred Hoffman, a 75-year-old art dealer in Santa Monica, Calif., were on their way to an art fair earlier this month when they got their text.
""You can't go. You're elderly. This is attacking elderly people,"" their 30-year-old son wrote from his office in San Francisco, Ms. Hoffman remembers.
The older Mr. Hoffman had just checked himself out of the hospital after a bout of pneumonia and the couple wasn't about to change their plans based on their son's text.
""I was thinking…Mr. Bossy,"" says Ms. Hoffman. ""We feel we are very much our own decision makers.""
They enjoyed the fair and are still healthy. But now the couple is no longer going out of the house. Ms. Hoffman ordered a climbing machine on Amazon so she can exercise while Mr. Hoffman practices yoga.
The online Merriam-Webster dictionary defines elderly as ""rather old"" and especially ""being past middle age"" without adding an official age cutoff. But the word has become controversial in recent years, particularly among gerontologists and those concerned with ageism.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What's your definition of ""elderly""? Join the conversation below.
""I'm vaguely hostile to the word elderly,"" says Thomas Cole, 70, a gerontologist and the author of ""Old Man Country: My Search for Meaning Among the Elders."" ""We live in an ageist culture and we have negative associations with words and images of old people.""
Mr. Cole notes that the American Geriatrics Society has stopped using the word elderly. ""If you submit a manuscript to them and you use elderly, they cross it out and substitute older,"" he adds.
A review of news releases and briefings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that while it warned of an increased risk from the coronavirus starting at age 60, it doesn't appear to have been using the word ""elderly."" The CDC didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mentions of the word came later, in news reports and with repeated use by health officials and politicians.
""We're baby boomers, we just don't see ourselves in that way,"" says Kimba Hills, 66, an interior designer based in Santa Monica. ""How did we get here?"" she laughs.
A week ago, her 27-year-old son voiced the opinion that she should not go to a work assignment in Florida later this month. Ms. Hills balked at first, determined to go, but just canceled her airline reservations.
""I became concerned about being quarantined there. Who would bring me food?"" asks Ms. Hills.
Instead, she and a friend decided to drive to a retreat in Palm Springs this past weekend. But on the drive there, the friend, Leslie Libman, 66, a television director, was barraged with concerned texts and calls from her son, who is 33.
""You would have thought I was dying,"" says Ms. Libman. ""You're an older person,"" her son said, ""and you can't go. Your immune system isn't great.""
Ms. Libman says she responded that she would be better off in the desert than in Los Angeles where everyone is ""losing their minds.""
Randi Danforth, 66, a publications director at the University of California, Los Angeles, says her 28-year-old daughter expressed concern about the coronavirus but wants her mother to go ahead and fly to Chicago for a visit later this month. Ms. Danforth is still planning to go.
""Our children are worried about us because we happen to fall into that weird category that we don't think we're in—elderly,"" says Ms. Danforth. ""The realm of the elder.""

| Jump to first hitThe scariest part, former NFL wide receiver Nate Hughes says, is just not knowing. Not knowing enough about the coronavirus. Not knowing if he could catch the disease during a shift, and unknowingly infect his family. Not knowing when a surge of cases, like the one that has overwhelmed health care facilities in New York, might strike his hospital in Mississippi.  ""You know it’s coming,"" Hughes told USA TODAY Sports. ""You just hope you’re prepared and hope everything’s in waiting, to help take care of people. "" Nearly eight years after his playing career ended, Hughes is now a first-year resident at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi — one of the tens of thousands of health care workers at the center of a global war against the coronavirus.  After graduating from medical school last spring, the 35-year-old is entering a demanding field during a particularly demanding time, working to master his specialty while at the same time providing critical care for patients during a pandemic — and putting himself at risk in the process.  ""It’s definitely tough,"" said Hughes, who is training to become an anesthesiologist. ""It’s one of those things where you do everything you can to prevent (yourself) from getting it and you do everything you can to keep from spreading it, but it appears so late that you don’t really know if you’ve been infected or if you’ve infected someone else. "" As the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly and unpredictably across the United States, leaving more than 4,500 people dead as of Thursday, it has brought devastation to states such as New York and Michigan, while others, like Mississippi, are still bracing for its impact.  WORKING OUT FROM HOME: Here's how one many ran a marathon while at home NFL POWER RANKINGS: Tom Brady's signing, free agency moves spark big changes Hughes said his hospital has established coronavirus units on certain floors and started screening doctors and nurses for symptoms before they enter the building every morning. UMMC spokesperson Ruth Cummins said there were 22 patients at the facility who had tested positive for coronavirus as of Thursday, in addition to an unspecified number of employees. Two patients have died.  Hughes said he's most worried not about whether he will get COVID-19 while at work but whether he will be asymptomatic and unknowingly infect others. His wife, Angel, is a Coast Guard pilot currently stationed in Miami. So when Mississippi schools went on spring break and later closed, Hughes left their three children — ages 5, 2 and four months — to stay with his parents, who are in their 60s and live a few hours away.  ""I’ve limited my exposure to my kids, to limit their exposure with the potential virus to my parents,"" he explained. ""It’s kind of weird. I have seen my kids in the past two and half, three weeks, but I haven’t really gotten a chance to engage and play with my kids in the past two and a half, three weeks. "" That lonesomeness has become one of the unforseen challenges of Hughes' job but a reality he accepts. He always seemed destined for this type of career, helping and serving others — even during the five years he spent as a wide receiver with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions, among other teams.  Hughes grew up learning about the profession through the eyes of his father, Nate Sr. , who is a nurse anesthetist at UMMC. In second grade, the younger Hughes said, he was told to write down what he wanted to be when he grew up. He wrote pro football player and doctor. Not either. Both. And then he made it happen.  While earning All-America honors at Football Championship Subdivision school Alcorn State, Hughes also pursued a nursing degree to gain practical experience. He stuck with football for a while, bouncing around active rosters and practice squads — but during the offseasons he would volunteer at local hospitals. And when the 2011 lockout hit, Hughes got a full-time job as a nurse.  Shortly thereafter, as he and his wife discussed starting a family, Hughes decided to fully pivot to a career in medicine.  ""Nate is one of those rare individuals who can do both,"" said Claude Brunson, an anesthesiologist and longtime family friend. ""He’s certainly not what you’d consider the traditional — as folks stereotype people — athlete or football player. "" Hughes' first year of residency has exposed him to various lines of work. He spent last month working in the hospital's internal medicine division, treating patients with ailments ranging from respiratory infections to hypertension and heart failure. This month, his focus is anesthesia, which will require him to spend more time working in patients' airways and lungs — and, in turn, potentially put him in closer contact with coronavirus.  At the end of June, Hughes will move to New Jersey, where he will spend the next three years continuing his anesthesia training while completing his residency at Rutgers.  ""Nate will be on the front lines of dealing with (coronavirus),"" said Brunson, who is also the executive director of the Mississippi State Medical Association. ""He will be in the specialty of physicians, along with critical care physicians, that are in line to take care of the ones who have become most critically ill and need ventilator support. "" For now, all Hughes can do is continue to work and wait. Mississippi only recently eclipsed 1,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Most models predict the state's caseload to peak in mid-April, though that could change as nearby cities like New Orleans experience their own surges.  Hughes said he continues to be amazed by how little is known about COVID-19. He recently dug up his notes about coronaviruses from his second year of medical school and found them to be eerily brief. This wasn't a major topic of study. It wasn't harped on.  ""So many people think they know so much about what’s going on, but in the grand scheme of things we really don’t know as much as we would like to know about the virus itself,"" Hughes said.  ""The scariest thing is not knowing. . . . Not knowing what’s to be expected and why it is the way it is. "" Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday. com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.

| Jump to first hitA patient who died from the virus had previously traveled on the vessel, which was heading toward San Francisco. About 20 people on board were showing symptoms.LOS ANGELES -- A normal day on board the Grand Princess cruise ship might go like this: Sleep late under a ""European-inspired duvet."" Take a dip in one of the pools on deck. Afternoon tea promises white tablecloths and finger sandwiches. Dinner could be lobster tails and steak on a private balcony. And all evening, there are plenty of things to do, from theater to gambling to dancing.""Expect the extraordinary,"" the company says in its advertising.Yet on Thursday, the cruise ship, on its way back to California from Hawaii with more than 2,000 passengers on board, was idling off the coast of San Francisco, as officials scrambled to confront the latest threat from the coronavirus and passengers panicked amid fears that they could be among the sick.Officials flew test kits by helicopter out to the Grand Princess after the authorities learned that a patient who had died from the coronavirus had previously traveled on the vessel, and that some passengers and crew members on board were showing symptoms.Eleven passengers and 10 crew members on the ship who were showing symptoms would be tested, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said. ""That number may significantly understate"" the scope of infection, he said, or ""it may indeed be abundance of caution.""Additionally, 62 people who had traveled at the same time as the man who died were expected to be tested for the virus, which is spreading worldwide and has led to 14 deaths in the United States.Two black helicopters hovered over the ship on Thursday morning, in the style of a military operation, as officials in camouflage and orange suits lowered what appeared to be a cooler and other gear onto the ship. After testing, the kits will be flown back to a laboratory in Richmond, Calif., where the results could be available within ""a few hours,"" Mr. Newsom said.Officials said that the results would likely not be announced until Friday. Bill Pearce, 54, said fellow passengers had been staying in good spirits and milling around the ship until Thursday afternoon, when the captain announced over loudspeakers that all passengers would be confined to their cabins.""We are seeing some people get kind of snappy,"" Mr. Pearce said, predicting that tensions would rise the longer the ship was delayed and passengers were forced to stay in their rooms.""I just stocked up on a bucket of beer and cheese,"" he said from a bar at the back of the ship, ""and then it's into the cabin.""As the coronavirus, which broke out in China last year, has spread across the globe, the United States is seeing a growing caseload, which on Thursday reached more than 200 cases in 18 states. In America, the focus of recent days has been on Washington State, which has seen 13 people die from the virus, most from a Seattle-area nursing home. But as officials grappled with what to do about the cruise ship off the coast of San Francisco, the attention is increasingly shifting to California, where 56 people have been treated for the coronavirus, the most of any state.Mr. Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency for California, to free up additional state and federal resources to fight the virus. The cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have also made emergency declarations.Mark Pace, a passenger aboard the Grand Princess, said Thursday that the passengers were generally staying calm. ""But it is getting more stressful as we approach Saturday, the day we're supposed to dock,"" he said.He said updates from the cruise staff had been slow and that he was dismayed that passengers weren't given a health screening when they boarded the cruise ship.""I had expected to have my temperature taken,"" he wrote in a tweet to Princess Cruises, the ship's parent company, on Wednesday. ""People that spent thousands of dollars on a cruise are not going to answer truthfully on their health form.""As the cruise ship floated off the coast, crew members canceled large gatherings and took extra precautions, cleaning surfaces more often and having wait staff serve food and drinks from the buffet. Some guests received notices under their doors on Wednesday telling them they would need to vacate their cabins when the helicopter arrived with the testing kits.Mr. Pace said that on Thursday the casino and other entertainment rooms were still open, but activities like bingo and nature walks that could attract crowds, were canceled. Mr. Pace was on the cruise to celebrate his wife Beth's birthday, and said they went to the dining room for breakfast Thursday morning but have decided to stay in their rooms for the time being.The panic over the fate of the Grand Princess began after a 71-year-old man who had traveled on a previous leg of the cruise, a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico, died in Placer County after leaving the ship. It was the first death from the coronavirus in California. Another passenger from that leg of the trip also tested positive for the virus and is being treated in California.The Grand Princess is owned by Princess Cruises, the same company that runs the Diamond Princess, the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan last month. The virus circulated among the more than 3,700 crew members and passengers who were waiting out a two-week isolation period in the port city of Yokohama, with more than 700 cases identified from that ship.The company on Thursday said it was canceling an upcoming cruise to Hawaii, which was scheduled to depart San Francisco on Saturday.When Michele Smith and her husband first heard over a loudspeaker that some passengers aboard would be quarantined, they weren't too worried and assumed the cruise staff was just taking extra precautions. It wasn't until several hours later, on Wednesday evening, when they found out on television that it was more than that -- a passenger who had been aboard the Grand Princess had died.""That's when the shock set in -- it was like, 'oh my goodness,""' Ms. Smith, a 57-year-old administrative assistant, said.She said she and her husband, Steven, 71, who live in Paradise, Calif., keep asking each other if they're feeling any flulike symptoms. Neither do. They had other questions, too. How long had the man been on the ship? Was he sick while he was on the ship? Why hadn't they found out earlier? She said the passengers want more guidance on what they can do to protect themselves from getting infected. So far, they've just been told to wash their hands and she's not sure what else she can do.Josee Yelle, 66, and her husband, Denis St. Pierre, 68, had already traveled to San Francisco to Montreal, intending to board the Grand Princess. On Thursday, they walked along Pier 27, where blue banners hung from light polls, with signs of cruise ships and the greeting, ""Bon Voyage.""""It's terrible,"" Ms. Yelle said of the virus. ""I think it's going to be very bad for travel agencies and the economy.""Officials in San Francisco were preparing for the possibility that the cruise ship could dock in the city, after passengers and crew members on board were tested for the virus.If some tests come back positive, it was unclear whether the ship would be quarantined, like the Diamond Princess ship was off the coast of Japan last month, or where or when the vessel would dock. Officials were considering a number of locations for the ship's return, including San Francisco.The developments came as officials announced the first two cases of coronavirus in San Francisco on Thursday.One patient, a man in his 90s with underlying health conditions, was hospitalized in serious condition. The other, a woman in her 40s, was hospitalized in fair condition. The origin of the cases were unknown, which officials said suggested that the virus was spreading in the community.""Let me be very clear: This virus does not discriminate,"" Dr. Grant Colfax, the public health director in San Francisco said, warning against bias toward the Asian community. ""Stigma and discrimination is not acceptable in this time when we need to come together as a community to protect public health. All of us need to do our part.""Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles, and Sarah Mervosh and Jenny Gross from New York. Carol Pogash contributed reporting from San Francisco.PhotographHelicopters took test kits to the Grand Princess, which was idling near San Francisco on Thursday.

By now the pandemic has touched your own little cubby of the universe: your own Costco, bereft of hand sanitizer; your own gym, which has closed until further notice. It's infiltrated your to-do list. I stood near a tired-looking mother Thursday at the supermarket while her small daughter asked whyyyy they had to be there, and the mother said, ""I told you, to get ready for the emergency,"" and the daughter said, ""Is it tonight?"" and the mother said, ""That's a good question,"" and then, ""Remember, if you're good, you can have two Oreos.""
Is the emergency happening tonight? Is it happening now? Your answers to those questions will depend on how many pallets of toilet paper you currently have in your pantry. When apocalypses seem imminent, rolls of toilet paper unspool into the yardage by which Americans measure panic. We can imagine no scenario worse than the world ending while our pants are around our ankles.
On Thursday, Walmart, Target and Amazon's online marketplaces were all out of stock, or close to it, and brick-and-mortar stores set limits of packs per customer until they ran out, too. An Australian newspaper printed eight extra blank pages, advertised as ""emergency toilet roll.""
So, when you went to the store, did you buy all the toilet paper? Did you shove 36 megarolls into your cart, and then smush in 36 more, because your primary concern, in all of this mess, was saving your own butt?
Or, did you stand in the aisle and do the math: How much toilet tissue is already in your linen closet, times the number of butts living in your house, divided by how long you think this apocalypse will last.
Did you also factor in the number of butts (and hands, and hearts, and lungs) in your town, your state, your time zone? Was your math simple, or was it made complex by a sincere belief that, just as public health depends on herd immunity, public sanity depends on herd empathy - meaning you acknowledge that everyone else's rear end is also on the line?
My job is to write about gender, and I've spent days trying to think of what that might mean in a pandemic. Men, dying at higher rates than women, at least in early reports from China? Women, bearing the brunt of extra child care and housework caused by closings, not to mention being the front lines of nursing and home health care? Men, who, at a rate of 69 percent, apparently do not regularly wash their hands in public bathrooms? The long social history that apparently led to this hand-washing gap, with century-old ad campaigns imploring women to be ""modern health crusaders""?
If you want to get really deep into the most woo-woo of gender stereotypes: On Wednesday you could have watched President Trump talk about using ""tough measures,"" ""vigilance"" and ""authority"" to ""defeat"" the virus. And then you could have watched former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson talk about the ""infinite love"" necessary for ""healing"" the world of the virus. She ended her guided meditation by staring into the camera and whispering, ""Go wash your hands."" Maybe there's something to be said about the language of combat vs. the language of cooperation - how they reflect masculine and feminine tropes and whether one is better suited than the other to the kind of war we're now in.
In truth, though, there is only one division that matters in a pandemic, and it is not gender.
It is whether you believe you deserve to hoard all the toilet paper.
Hoarding all the toilet paper means one of two things: One, you think you are genuinely more worthy of comfort, and if other people wanted to be comfortable then they should have bought all the toilet paper first. Two, it never even occurred to you that, if you buy everything, someone else is going to come in - someone who had a different work schedule or was waiting to get paid - and they will not be able to buy anything.
The medical historian Frank Snowden gave an interview to the New Yorker recently about pandemics and epidemics and what they mean for societies. ""Epidemics are a category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are,"" he told the magazine. ""They show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people.""
We are in the very early stages of learning how those moral relationships will be revealed in the age of coronavirus. We're still in the double-take period, the that's-a-good-question period. Disneyland only just closed. The Kennedy Center only just closed. The NBA only just suspended its season. Things could get so much weirder and more surreal, as we fight to put aside our own comfort and think of the older, the sicker, the weaker among us. The time of making calculations is just beginning. Will your math be simple or complex?
We are not in a state of emergency if you are down to your last three rolls of toilet paper. We are in a state of emergency if you have 96 rolls, and some people have no rolls, and you don't care.

| Jump to first hitThe coronavirus pandemic could sharpen the health risks of loneliness. But there are ways to connect.At midmorning, Lisa Carfagna, a marketing staffer for the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, took a brief break from working at home on Long Island and called the Rubins on the Upper East Side.They were doing fine, Seymour Rubin, 89, assured her over a speakerphone.""We try to have a project every day,"" said Shirley Rubin, 84. ""Today, I'm making a beef stew for the first time in 40 years.""""If I'm here tomorrow,"" her husband put in, ""you'll know it was good.""When the coronavirus outbreak forced the Y to shutter last month -- leaving participants in its senior program bereft of their usual lectures, classes and exercise programs -- about 70 staff members quickly volunteered to make weekly calls to all 650 of them. Ms. Carfagna regularly checks in with 25.Like many cultural organizations, the Y has turned to digital technology -- streamed concerts and lectures, classes on Zoom, discussion groups via conference call -- to keep its older patrons engaged.But computers and smartphones can feel daunting; about a third of Americans over 65 told Pew Research they weren't confident about using digital technology. About half said they needed help in setting up new devices. Some seniors lack broadband connection.Besides, ""there's something about that live, person-to-person connection,"" said Julia Zeuner, who directs the senior program and mobilized the volunteers. ""A friendly voice on the other end of the line.""Social isolation and loneliness among older adults have become such a concern that two years ago, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine assembled an expert committee to analyze research findings and make recommendations.Its report arrived in late February -- as the coronavirus spread.Now, older people have been sternly warned to adopt the very practices that, the committee found, can endanger their health. With senior centers, day programs, theaters, parks, gyms and restaurants closed and most in-person visiting prohibited, they are enduring a lengthening period of social separation. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are barring family members.""It's a public health crisis that should be recognized,"" said Colleen Galambos, a committee member and a gerontologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ""People who normally wouldn't be considered isolated or lonely are now experiencing it.""These are not the same state, the National Academies report pointed out. Social isolation refers to an objective lack of social contact with others; loneliness, a subjective sense of being left out and ignored, can strike even when people are surrounded by others.By itself, aging doesn't create either problem. But it raises the risks. ""Many older people, especially women over 75, are living by themselves because their spouses died,"" said Dr. Dan Blazer, the committee chair and a psychiatrist at the Duke University School of Medicine.Retirement, difficulty driving, hearing and vision loss, cognitive or physical problems that make getting out difficult -- all contribute to a troubling tide of disconnection.About a quarter of people over 65 living independently in their communities are considered socially isolated, and 43 percent of those over 60 report feeling lonely -- and that was before public health officials instructed older people, and everyone else, to stay home.""It's not just touchy-feely stuff,"" said Dr. Ken Covinsky, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, who has been a co-author on studies on loneliness. ""Isolation is a real risk.""In fact, it's associated with significantly higher rates of heart disease and stroke and a 50 percent increased risk of dementia, the National Academies report pointed out. Isolated or lonely seniors report a greater incidence of depression and anxiety.They suffer a mortality rate comparable to that linked to smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.When the committee looked for promising solutions, it found studies showing that attending exercise programs helped reduce isolation -- not a useful approach at the moment. The evidence for much-heralded technological approaches, from robotic pets and Zoom to voice-activated assistants, remains thin thus far.How, then, to help older people maintain their social connections when they're supposed to be socially, or at least physically, distanced? Individuals and organizations around the country are proposing and trying a variety of tactics.Dr. Covinsky, particularly concerned about restrictions on visitors to older people at home or in senior facilities, has suggested that as coronavirus testing becomes more broadly available, family members or friends who repeatedly test negative could become ""designated visitors,"" permitted to spend time with their quarantined loved ones.""We have restricted something that's pretty essential,"" he said. ""We need to move away from thinking of visitors to old people as optional.""In Southern California, two PACE programs -- federally funded efforts to provide full medical and social services for those aging in place -- have leased tablets called GrandPads for their roughly 250 participants. Designed for those over 75, the devices allow seniors to call the PACE center, receive and reply to email, and receive video calls from PACE staff members (and play games).At the Queens Public Library in New York, program assistants are calling about 50 homebound patrons each week to remind them of programs available by phone and to check on their well-being, said Madlyn Schneider, the older adult coordinator.In Los Angeles, the Motion Picture and Television Fund has fielded a groundswell of new volunteers for its Daily Call Sheet program, which matches them with older people who share their entertainment industry backgrounds.The volunteers, once vetted and trained, call once or twice a week. ""It's reminiscing and connecting and fundamental human conversation,"" said Dr. Scott Kaiser, the geriatrician who established the program.The Friendship Line in San Francisco similarly operates a ""warmline,"" though without the industry link. It has also seen a surge in users, and so many new volunteers that it has resorted to a waiting list.Dr. Blazer reports that the drivers delivering Meals on Wheels to his 96-year-old mother-in-law in suburban Atlanta, instead of just dropping off food as usual, now tap on her door and chat from across the hallway of her independent living building. ""They have a conversation from six feet away,"" he said. ""She says it makes a huge difference.""However heartened by such efforts, Dr. Blazer cautioned that ""social isolation isn't going away."" He worries about what will happen when some degree of normalcy dawns -- and millions of isolated or lonely elders recede from public attention.""We'll find ways to adapt to this, but my hope for older people is that we don't forget them,"" he said. ""If this epidemic has taught us anything, it's that we have to reach out.""Individuals can do that, too. My friend Peg Rosen, a freelance writer in suburban New Jersey, has begun FaceTiming with her mother-in-law in Manhattan every morning.They work the New York Times crossword puzzle together, just as they used to on Sundays in a city coffee shop, a pleasure now forbidden them. (To subvert generational stereotypes, it's Ms. Rosen, 56, who prefers doing the puzzle on paper; the 87-year-old is using her tablet.)""It's delightful, a highlight of my day,"" Ms. Rosen reported. ""I think we'll continue when this all ends.""[ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter. ]Photograph(PHOTOGRAPH BY Stuart Briers FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1196Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

For many years, the world of mass-market beauty and personal care has traded in gender tropes and stereotypes. Think about thick blue disposable razors vs. dainty pink ones; pine-scented, dark green deodorant sticks vs. flower-scented, pastel-packaged antiperspirant; leathery-smelling aftershave in wood-topped bottles vs. pink face lotion in clear jars. In some cases, although the products aren't very different - a razor is a razor - the packaging makes the target demographic clear.
But as skin-care-obsessed young women share their enthusiasm with their brothers and partners, a teen like James Charles takes a turn as the face of CoverGirl, and male beauty experts on YouTube show other men how to apply cosmetics, the traditional gender lines are blurring, if not disappearing altogether. And while it's too soon to tell whether men will embrace makeup with anything approaching women's fervor, one trend is obvious, observers say: Beauty brands are pivoting toward more gender-neutral products presented in unisex packaging. 
Newer brands are entering the gate with gender fluidity already built into their DNA, experts say, using advertising that reflects diversity in race and gender, and packaging products in ways that avoid old stereotypes. ""They're more inclusive, and they hit on more of the things that are important to younger consumers today, like 'sustainable' or 'clean' or 'genderless,' "" said Larissa Jensen, senior beauty analyst at market research firm NPD Group. ""That's something that's more of a movement from a younger consumer perspective.""
 Oft-cited brands popular with Generation Z (defined by the Pew Research Center as people born from 1997 onward) such as Milk Makeup, Glossier and Fenty Beauty all feature diverse casts in advertisements, interact with their customers on social media, offer numerous shades to cater to different skin tones and use neutral colors in packaging such as gray, white, pale pink, nude and silver. (Milk Makeup and Glossier did not respond to interview requests about their advertising and packaging strategies, and a representative for Fenty Beauty's public relations firm declined to comment.) ""Our goal is really to evolve the mainstream conception of beauty while creating a space for people to express themselves authentically,"" said Laura Kraber, co-founder and chief executive of We Are Fluide, a gender-neutral makeup brand founded in 2018. ""Our packaging and product development has tried to not be extremely masculine or feminine, and we discard those notions generally because our whole belief is that gender is more of a constellation than an extreme of one or the other,"" said Kraber, who is a parent of two teenagers. ""If makeup is joyful and transformative and fun, nobody should be left out."" 
Younger consumers are largely credited with eroding gender norms and definitions, and studies suggest they have less rigid definitions of masculinity and gender identity than older customers do. A 2019 Pew survey of 10,000 Americans found that about 59 percent of members of Generation Z said forms that ask about a person's gender should include options besides ""male"" and ""female,"" compared with 50 percent of millennials (ages 22 to 37 in 2018) and 37 percent of baby boomers (54 to 72 in 2018).
 David Yi, founder of Very Good Light, a men's online grooming publication focused on Gen Z that aims to ""redefine masculinity and men's beauty standards,"" credits that generation's openness to its innate fluency with social media and its global worldview. Yi, who is penning a book about the history of male makeup, notes that men around the world have used cosmetics at various points in history, and that it is more associated with femininity in Western cultures. ""We're slowly untangling that with Gen Z,"" he said. ""They're cognizant that American or Western culture isn't the end-all, be-all."" 
According to NPD Group, although makeup revenue sales across the board have declined, skin-care sales have increased. Jensen said that, for men, there's less of a barrier to entry for skin care because it lacks the ""gendered focus"" that makeup as a category has traditionally carried. Clare Hennigan, senior beauty analyst at Mintel, a market research firm, has observed growth in the men's skin-care category and notes that ""across the board, we've seen men taking more care of their personal routines."" 
One brand poised to take advantage of this shift is the Ordinary, which Jensen called ""the ultimate genderless skin care."" It offers serums, creams and acids that range from about $5 to $20 in simple, clinical-looking packaging. Its unisex look is intentional. ""Since its conception, [the Ordinary] was never intended to target a specific gender identity in any capacity,"" Nicola Kilner, co-founder and chief executive of the Ordinary's parent company, Deciem, wrote in an email. ""The packaging of the line, much like the formulations, was always about being straight to the point and educational."" She adds that the brand doesn't feature models in campaigns or on social media, but rather uses its own employees because ""we feel as though we are a representation of our fan base - diverse, passionate, in love with skin care and ultimately, just human beings.""
Ursa Major, a skin-care brand co-founded by Oliver Sweatman and Emily Doyle, also has gone all-in on genderless products. The line, whose customer Sweatman and Doyle call ""the mindful explorer,"" includes face, hair and body products containing natural ingredients that are sold in eco-friendly packaging featuring blue, green and white mountain outlines. 
The couple, veterans of the beauty industry, started the brand in 2009 after moving from New York to Vermont ""to reboot"" and realizing they were sharing many products. ""My personal take is that the lion's share of products can be used equally by any gender,"" said Sweatman, whose aim is ""a healthier product that delivered nourishment in a non-gendered way."" 
Colors aside, recent packaging tends to be simpler and more pared-back. ""When you think about the trends in packaging, and I think skin care has this more, it's not pink, it's not black or blue; it's very clean and very simple,"" Jensen said. Steve Seeley, president of Elitefill, a packaging company that specializes in cosmetics and skin care, has noticed that packaging has become more straightforward in the 20 years he has worked in the beauty space. ""I think it's probably the Apple concept of just being basic, clean and clear with your message,"" he said. ""I think what [brands] realized is make it simple: Say what it does, and let the product speak for itself.""
At this stage, the types of products being marketed to male-identifying customers are simple, too. According to NPD, the top-growing products are tinted moisturizers, lip glosses, lip balms and brow products - all items that contribute to a pared-back, minimalist makeup look. 
Glen Jankowski, a senior lecturer in critical and social psychology at Leeds Beckett University in England who studies body image, wonders what effect this has. ""It's promoting a very unrealistic standard in a pernicious way,"" he said. ""At least with expressive, bold makeup, people know it's decoration and it's not part of your appearance. With this more hidden, subtle makeup, it's more like, 'This is what a human should look like.' ""

Phillip Picardi, former editor of Out and Them, started a grooming column for GQ in November, with subjects such as how to look younger, how to groom eyebrows and a beginner's guide to makeup. He acknowledged the possibility that holding men as well as women to beauty standards could be a step backward. ""It's not a good thing for us to be peddling consumerism to men and women,"" he said. ""The answer would be to eradicate all of it. But it's just not the world we live in.""

"THE NATION; With Ebola, Dallas learned about fear's role in outbreak","Hide highlightingFull TextTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation
| Jump to first hitYoungor Jallah was quarantined with her family of five, unable to work and stigmatized because she had cared for a relative before he died of a deadly virus.
That was six years ago, when the first U.S. Ebola case was diagnosed in Dallas. But the stigma continued even after Jallah emerged from voluntary quarantine.
""On the bus,"" she recalls, ""they were calling my children 'Ebola children.' ""

Dallas emerged from the Ebola scare with only one death, that first patient, and those close to the case now say they learned that fighting outbreaks like that of the coronavirus means combating fear as well as disease.
Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has urged residents against hoarding and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We made it through Ebola, we made it through H1N1, and we're going to make it through this,"" Abbott said.
Dallas officials made similar assurances even as they declared a public health emergency March 13 and ordered residents Sunday to stay home.
""What we need to do as a state and a nation is to follow the science. And the only way to do it is to stay calm,"" said Clay Jenkins, the chief executive of Dallas County who has held office since 2011, before Ebola hit Dallas.
That outbreak began when Thomas Duncan, the fiance of Jallah's mother who was visiting Dallas from Liberia, sought treatment at a local hospital. Within a week, he died. Soon after, two nurses who had cared for Duncan were also diagnosed with Ebola. Both were treated and quarantined, and they survived.
Jallah's mother, Louise Troh, her then-13-year-old son and two older nephews were exposed and asked to stay home. Fear of the local West African community began to mount.
""They said African people are dumb. We are not dumb. We are real people,"" Troh said in a recent phone interview.
Cashiers in her neighborhood started wearing latex gloves. Parents expressed fear of sending their children to school. Crowds formed outside the apartment complex where she lived.
Officials ultimately forced 43 people, including Troh's family, to remain quarantined for a month.
Troh and her relatives were moved to a house provided by the Catholic diocese, their apartment decontaminated by industrial cleaners, their furniture and belongings destroyed to prevent the disease's spread.
""I lost all my items, and I was thinking I was going to lose my kids,"" she said.
What reassured her and many others was seeing Jenkins visit the family without a hazmat suit, first at their apartment, then at the house where they were later quarantined.
Jenkins said he helped Troh's family move ""out of necessity.""
""No one else would do it,"" he said by phone. ""It had the benefit that I did not recognize at the time of calming the public and sending a message to people of acceptance of their fellow person.""
Troh, 59, and her family were eventually declared Ebola-free, released from quarantine and stayed in Dallas. Duncan is the only person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. who died.
When news of the coronavirus broke, Troh got upset. But after calling Jenkins, she said, she felt relieved.
""This is a whole different story"" from Ebola, she said. ""People should not panic. Keep clean. Wash your hands.""
Coronavirus and Ebola are both scary from a medical standpoint, but for different reasons.
The two have some of the same initial symptoms, but Ebola often causes dramatic bleeding and has an average fatality rate of 50%, far higher than the coronavirus has had thus far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And in the U.S. right now, the coronavirus is easier to catch.
As the virus spread to Texas, Jenkins acknowledged that the xenophobia Dallas experienced during the Ebola scare has surfaced again, this time against members of Asian and Asian American communities.
He said he has tried to emphasize, as he did during the Ebola outbreak, that although the disease may have arrived from overseas, community members need to work together to prevent it from spreading locally. He noted that in the last week, Dallas and other Texas cities reported their first cases of the coronavirus being spread through the community, not via travelers from overseas.
""Xenophobia about people who look a certain way or have traveled to a certain country is no longer relevant when you have community spread,"" Jenkins said.
So far, 627 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Texas, including at least 131 in Dallas County, which has had three deaths -- two of them reported Sunday.
Jenkins held a briefing Sunday -- just as he had daily during the Ebola outbreak -- to issue the stay-at-home order after conferring with local doctors and hospital leaders. Before declaring an emergency and banning meetings of 500 or more people March 13, he met with leaders of local cities, houses of worship and businesses to allay their fears.
Former Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings recalled that during the prior crisis, he and Jenkins were careful to offer as many facts as they could -- and to also admit what they didn't know.
""The public can't be tricked,"" said Rawlings, a former Pizza Hut chief executive. ""The way I dealt with it was giving them more information versus less, and that worked.""
""I'm concerned [that] with this there's going to be a lot of pain and deaths,"" said Rawlings, emphasizing that expanded testing is crucial.
""The key is to keep this as short as we can and keep the infections as low as we can,"" Rawlings said.
Rawlings never declared a health emergency or limited public gatherings during the Ebola outbreak, as Jenkins and the current mayor did for the coronavirus, and it was ultimately contained. But the U.S. is beyond containing the coronavirus, Rawlings said, and such drastic steps are worth the risk to mitigate the virus' reach.
Dr. Daniel Varga, former chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which includes the hospital where the Ebola crisis unfolded, has since moved to New Jersey, where he serves as chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health. He is now responding there to the coronavirus.
In both outbreaks, Varga said, ""healthcare providers are on the front line and they're at risk. If you're going to treat it and stem the tide, people have to step into the breach. It takes really brave people to do that.""
He said hospitals have to not only provide training and protective equipment to ease concerns among those on the front lines but also add staffing and support.
Varga said public fears are also stoked by the lack of testing and accurate measures of how fast the virus is spreading.
""We have to be honest right now, we've been living in a world of [coronavirus] testing deficits,"" he said. ""We've had folks who wanted to get tested and we've let them know we have a queue of people in the ER in isolation rooms who we still don't have tests for.""
During the Ebola outbreak, the hospital Varga oversaw was criticized first for misdiagnosing Duncan, which delayed his care and placed others at risk, and later for safety failures that led the two nurses to become infected. It became, he acknowledged, ""the Ebola hospital.""
""It took the hospital a long time to bounce back from that,"" he said.
Jallah also tired of living with the Ebola stigma in Dallas. She had stayed because her husband didn't want to move. But last year, she found a job in Iowa and moved with her children, leaving their father behind.
She settled in Cedar Rapids with children Rose, 11; King, 9; and Prophet, 7.
Jallah works at a nursing home and didn't tell co-workers about her Ebola ordeal until after they noticed her becoming preoccupied with news of the coronavirus.
""We are doing all precautions, using hand sanitizer, hand washing. We're just very careful,"" she said of her family.
She tries not to worry. But each day when she reports to work, her temperature is taken, along with those of her co-workers, as a precaution against the disease.
""Anybody can have it, you don't know,"" she said.

Mike Wirth was upbeat when he told a roomful of investors in New York's St. Regis Hotel on March 3 he would bump elbows instead of shake hands at Chevron Corp.'s annual analyst meeting. It was two days after New York reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19.
Chevron handed out hand sanitizer as swag instead of the travel power adapters and souvenir pieces of shale rock it had in the past. The chief executive assured the room his company had enough cash to ride out any serious downturn.
Eight days later, on March 11, David MacLennan was at home when a text from his sister flashed the name ""Rudy Gobert."" It took the Cargill Inc. CEO a moment to place him as a basketball player who had just tested positive for coronavirus. The National Basketball Association was suspending its season.
Mr. MacLennan briefly wondered what ESPN would talk about without sports. Then his mind turned to the empty stadiums that serve burgers made from the agriculture giant's beef, on buns baked with the wheat that Cargill trades. ""What's next?"" he asked his senior executives in a private group chat.
By March 27, a new reality was gripping the nation. Macy's Inc. boss Jeff Gennette had kept all 125,000 employees on the payroll since the company had closed its stores but couldn't do it any longer.
Nobody was shopping, and it was unclear if they would come back when stores reopened. Mr. Gennette had already suspended Macy's dividend and borrowed $1.5 billion from its banks. Now he decided to furlough most of his workers. ""What if every store is closed through May?"" Mr. Gennette worried.
It was a month unlike anything American business has experienced. The U.S. entered March still riding an 11-year economic expansion. Unemployment was at 3.5%, a 50-year low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had recently been flirting with 30000. The biggest worry for many companies was finding workers to fill positions.
By the end of the month, 10 million had lost their jobs. The Dow was at 21917. Airlines were on the verge of bankruptcy. Other icons of American commerce were shutting down, seeking government aid, shedding staff and wondering whether their businesses even made sense anymore. Countless small enterprises failed.
As of Friday, about 6,900 Americans were dead of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, with the toll expected to increase exponentially in coming weeks.
The speed of the spread and the depth of the impact caught corporate leaders off guard. Macy's stores and McDonald's dining rooms were locked. Malls and movie theaters went dark. Disney World closed, as did Detroit's auto factories. Professional sports were suspended. The Olympics were postponed.
Before the month was out, Marriott International Inc. stopped paying tens of thousands of people. General Electric Co. cut staff. Ford Motor Co. suspended its dividend. Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. struggled to keep stocked and staffed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. borrowed from the Federal Reserve's rainy day fund.
""Just never seen anything, remotely, like how fast it turned,"" said Scott Kirby, the president and soon-to-be CEO of United Airlines.
Some routines may not return, which means some giants won't survive. People stopped dining out or going to the movies. Will they return? Corporate workers left their headquarters, and families abandoned cities. When will people feel it's safe again to fly or go out for a beer?
America's 500 biggest public companies were worth $3 trillion less at the end of the month than they were at the beginning.
During the month the heads of America's biggest companies felt constantly in the dark. Many sought out hospital CEOs, government officials or health experts to find out what they knew.
Pfizer Inc.'s CEO Albert Bourla choked up when he pushed his scientists to have a vaccine by the fall. Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman raced to get cash from the bank. Michael Corbat bought extra routers to run his global bank, Citigroup Inc., from home.
The first U.S. death came on the last day of February. A man in his 50s died in Washington state, where a nursing home had become the virus's first U.S. hot zone. A few days earlier, officials had warned of a wider outbreak and limited flights to and from China and Italy.
The White House projected confidence in the U.S. response. ""The risk is low,"" said Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We need to get on with our normal lives.""

Starbucks Corp. told its U.S. baristas to start regularly sanitizing door handles, chairs, tables and coffee bars.
The coffee giant had seen the effects of the virus first hand in China, where the outbreak had forced it to close about half of its 4,300 cafes in mid-January.
Rough numbers drawn up by CEO Kevin Johnson and his finance chief were grim.
While driving over one of Seattle's skybridges to work on Jan. 21, Mr. Johnson heard the morning news report of the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. ""Here we go,"" he said to himself.
Monday, March 2
Like Starbucks, IMAX Corp. has significant operations in China and had spent the past month watching the virus escalate to the point of closing theaters, including 702 of its signature big screens.
With the virus spreading in the U.S., CEO Richard Gelfond tapped acquaintances to connect with experts, including a former CDC official. He called Samuel Stanley, the president of Michigan State University and a biomedical researcher whom Mr. Gelfond knew from his work with Stony Brook University, his alma mater.
The conversations left him convinced that the number of cases in the U.S. was likely to skyrocket, especially as he learned how little testing had been done. The pressure on theaters to close would rise and IMAX would have a sequel to China on its hands, this time in the world's No. 1 box-office market.
His company had $100 million in cash, but that wouldn't last long if the lights went out in its theaters. He borrowed the company's entire $300 million credit line and started scrimping where he could. ""Cancel anything you can get your money back on,"" Mr. Gelfond told his team.
Chevron's jet ferried Mr. Wirth to New York, where he and his wife took their daughter's college roommate to dinner at Gramercy Tavern. It was still full.
Citigroup opened a backup office in Rutherford, N.J., across a swamp from the New York Giants' football stadium. The goal was to spread out staff and have a backup in case of an outbreak on the main trading floor in Manhattan. It started moving traders slowly, in case it overloaded the system.
How many are sick? How many dead? An operations technocrat, Citigroup boss Mr. Corbat focused on the stats. He ran a global bank with operations in 160 countries, including places where the virus had already been spreading fast.
""You can't go where it is. You'll already be two weeks behind,"" Mr. Corbat told his lieutenants in a meeting. ""Project where it's going.""
David Calhoun and his peers at Boeing Co. held the first of what became routine internal calls about preparing for the coronavirus crisis. The CEO said the company should expect a sharp decline in air-travel demand. Boeing's medical staff had flagged reports about the new virus in China in early January.
Discussions touched on potential layoffs. Mr. Calhoun said Boeing needed to be careful, telling colleagues, ""We cannot recover from this if we don't have the people we need to build these airplanes.""
Tuesday, March 3
FedEx Corp. executives gathered to review the fiscal quarter that had ended over the weekend. They had 14 days to decide what to tell Wall Street.
The Federal Reserve had surprised markets that day with an emergency half-point rate cut -- the central bank's first rate change in between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis.
FedEx had already seen the virus tear across China, where it had 900 employees on lockdown in the city of Wuhan, and seen the early signs of the carnage in Italy. The company was disinfecting cockpits and providing protective equipment to mechanics.
Data coming into the company's computer systems from around the globe were confounding. ""The lights are flashing red,"" said CEO Fred Smith, ""We can't forecast this.""
Mindy Grossman flew to Denver to attend the final leg of Oprah Winfrey's sold-out ""2020 Vision"" tour, a concert-like pep rally hosted by her company, WW International Inc., better known as Weight Watchers.
At a board meeting in Denver a few days before the event, concerns about the coronavirus were growing. Ms. Grossman, Ms. Winfrey and the rest of the WW board discussed having more hand sanitizer at the venue and steps they could take to protect the roughly 12,000 people who would attend.
Wednesday, March 4
United Airlines said it would cut flying by 20% internationally and 10% in the U.S. Over the next few days the airline lined up $2 billion in new debt and slashed spending by $2.5 billion.
Mr. Kirby had been in China in January, and had shaken hands and taken selfies with employees at another event. He had gotten sick, a rarity, and wondered at one point if he had contracted Covid-19.
In February, a surge of infections in northern Italy had left Milan under quarantine and convinced Mr. Kirby that the virus would tear through the rest of the world.
""It's too late to put the genie in the bottle and stop it,"" he told his team in late February. ""We're going to have dramatically fewer people flying if that's true."" He realized United needed to cut costs and raise capital, and that the industry couldn't avoid mass furloughs without government aid.
Dara Khosrowshahi took the stage at a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco and struck a different tone. The Uber Technologies Inc. chief had made a tall promise in February, vowing that the money-losing company would turn a profit by the end of 2020.
Coronavirus won't change that, he told the crowd. After all, the hardest hit countries at the time -- China, South Korea and Iran -- made for less than 1% of Uber's rides bookings.
Saturday, March 7
Chevron's Mr. Wirth watched with worry one of the first shots fired in an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The monthly crude oil prices being offered by Saudi Arabia were $6 to $8 per barrel below U.S. prices.
The message was clear: Saudi Arabia was opening a spigot of cheap oil in a bid for market share. Mr. Wirth's industry faced a dual disaster of falling demand and increasing supply.
""We're in an entirely different world,"" he thought as he boarded Chevron's jet the next day for a flight back to his San Ramon, Calif., headquarters.
Sunday, March 8
Randall Stephenson, the chief of AT&T Inc., was talking with a half-dozen fellow CEOs at a conference hotel in Georgia. What are we dealing with right now? What are we facing? Robert Bradway, the CEO of drugmaker Amgen Inc., told them about a phone call he'd gotten from a contact in China. He walked the group through the numbers.
""Holy cow,"" Mr. Stephenson said. That night he told his finance chief to activate the ""black swan"" plan that AT&T breaks out when wildfires or earthquakes disrupt its business. It hadn't modeled for a pandemic.
Monday, March 9
Oil prices fell 24%, their worst day since the Gulf War in 1991. Mr. Wirth convened his closest advisers with a message: ""We're going to have to make some fundamental changes.""
The Chevron team analyzed how bad things could get. What if oil storage fills up? What if the market is oversupplied by 20 million barrels a day? How would Chevron move equipment and personnel if travel restrictions tightened? How could the company protect workers on weekslong shifts in remote locations?
Tuesday, March 10
Bill Hornbuckle was in MGM Resorts International's corporate offices in the Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas Strip, when the interim CEO got an unscheduled visit. A staffer who handles crisis management told him a New York woman who had stayed the previous weekend at the company's Mirage casino tested positive for coronavirus.
The guest had been a speaker at a ""Women of Power Summit."" Among the people she'd been in contact with were MGM employees who attended the conference.
Las Vegas was still in business. The prior Saturday night, 5,000 people went to a Bruno Mars concert at an MGM venue and 15,000 watched an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at the company's T-Mobile Arena. ""I was somewhat shocked by the level of activity,"" Mr. Hornbuckle said. ""You wouldn't have known anything was going on at that end of the Strip.""
Later that day, more bad news arrived. A man who worked at a horse track in Yonkers, N.Y., where MGM operates the Empire City Casino, had died after being diagnosed with Covid-19.
""We're going to have to close,"" Mr. Hornbuckle went home thinking. If that happened, 60,000 people would be out of work.
Shoppers in a Tacoma, Wash., mall heard an announcement at 6 p.m. over the public address system. The Macy's store was closing early. Managers and store associates escorted customers out.
A Macy's employee had tested positive for coronavirus. The employee had not been at work for seven days. The store was deep cleaned and disinfected overnight.
It reopened at 11 a.m. the next day, an hour later than normal.
Macy's repeated this process at roughly a dozen of its more than 800 stores around the country over the next week. The retailer fielded calls from state and local officials either suggesting or mandating its stores close.
Macy's principal concern at a board meeting in late February had been the disruption to its supply chain in China. ""The impact of the virus on our business could be 10 times what we had initially expected,"" thought Mr. Gennette, the CEO.
Wednesday, March 11
The CEOs of seven banks gathered at the White House guard station a little after 2 p.m. Mr. Trump wanted to discuss their ability to keep lending. Charlie Scharf had been in charge at Wells Fargo & Co. just six months and had spent most of it trying to clean up a fake-accounts scandal that had dogged the bank for three years.
Mr. Scharf is a trustee at Johns Hopkins University, his alma mater, and the week before had spoken with the head of its medical school, Dr. Paul Rothman. Even as U.S. government officials were playing down the risk of a pandemic, Johns Hopkins's models were bleak.
""This is going to be serious,"" Mr. Scharf told top lieutenants the week before, ordering them to start preparing Wells Fargo, with its 260,000 employees and $2 trillion of assets.
At the White House, the door to the Roosevelt Room swung open and CEOs of the country's biggest hospital systems filed out. Dr. Rothman and Mr. Scharf exchanged nods.
Hospital executives had urged the administration to prioritize their patients for coronavirus testing. Doctors and nurses were burning through dwindling stock of protective masks and gowns, the executives said. Faster test results would rule out some patients and preserve critical gear.
Sam Hazen, the CEO of HCA Healthcare Inc., warned hospitals would be hard-hit financially, too. Revenue from elective patients would fall at hospitals just as they increased spending to prepare for critically ill coronavirus patients.
In Chicago, executives of CME Group Inc. met in a conference room overlooking the city's river. The agenda: What should they do about the futures exchange's trading floor? Even though markets were now mostly digital, hundreds of traders were still gathering a few blocks away in CME's pits, haggling over commodities like wheat and cattle.
The symbol of a bygone age of American capitalism was also a potential cesspool. The World Health Organization had earlier that day declared the spread of the virus a pandemic.
Close it down, CEO Terrence Duffy said. Mr. Duffy, a former hog-futures trader, had been following news of the virus closely, and not just because of his job: In 2017, he had suffered a collapsed lung, and he was at high risk from Covid-19.
CME said the floor would shut down after two more days of trading, becoming the first major U.S. exchange to take such a step. Mr. Duffy told floor traders complaining about lost profits, ""We can do all the deep-cleaning we want, but if someone brings the virus in five minutes later, it's irrelevant.""
That evening, he flipped on the television to watch Mr. Trump's televised address from the Oval Office. The president said he was banning travel from most of Europe. ""This is not a financial crisis,"" Mr. Trump said. ""This is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation, and as a world.""
The president finished speaking at 9:12 p.m. ET. Twenty five minutes later, the National Basketball Association announced its plans to suspend play.
Just before the game between the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder was set to tip off, Thunder executive Donnie Strack dashed onto the court toward the officials and shared disturbing news: Mr. Gobert, the Jazz center who was out with an illness, had tested positive for Covid-19.
American professional sports had a patient zero. The players were yanked off the court and would not return. ""Take your time in leaving the arena tonight, and do so in an orderly fashion,"" a voice boomed on the arena's public-address system. ""Thank you for coming out tonight. We are all safe.""
The shutdown of the NBA season -- and an Instagram post hours later from actor Tom Hanks broadcasting that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, were sick -- shocked many Americans who had viewed the virus as a distant threat.
TV network executives began working to assess the giant financial impact of losing the NBA -- and how to fill their airwaves with other programming.
ESPN would consider: Could they get the rights to air WrestleMania from World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.? What about a seven-hour marathon of NFL game footage featuring Tom Brady?
Thursday, March 12
Sean Connolly, the CEO of food maker Conagra Brands Inc., saw panic buying take off.
The hoarding started with dry goods like Chef Boyardee pastas and Hunt's canned tomatoes, but quickly extended to his company's Healthy Choice frozen entrees and Birds Eye frozen vegetables.
""It just skyrocketed,"" Mr. Connolly said. ""You name it, it's moving.""
The rest of the professional leagues followed the NBA. Soon the NCAA basketball tournament was canceled. Disney said it would close all its parks.
Mr. Ackman, the hedge-fund manager, was in the middle of the biggest trade of his life. That morning he told his traders to unwind a bet he had made against the market. The bearish trade, made near the peak of the market in February, was worth more than $2 billion as stocks collapsed. He wanted it sold.
The billionaire investor, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, had been nervous since early January. He had been scouring reports out of China and became alarmed when it was confirmed the then-unnamed virus could pass between people and live for days on surfaces.
He told employees to roll down the window when they took cabs. He worried about his mother and father, a lung cancer survivor, who moved into his penthouse off Central Park.
He urged companies in his investment portfolio, which include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and real-estate developer Howard Hughes Corp., to tap bank loans and build cash piles. Mr. Ackman did the same himself, calling a JPMorgan branch in New York City to withdraw cash.
Kraft Heinz Co. told retailers it was limiting orders to full pallets on certain products. Grocery chains couldn't order 1.5 pallets of macaroni-and-cheese boxes anymore. They would need to order two. That helped the plants and warehouses pack and send off pallets faster.
Kraft Heinz added third shifts at many factories and limited the variety of Oscar Mayer lunch meats and other foods to maximize its production. ""We are changing the rules by the minute,"" thought Miguel Patricio, the CEO of Kraft Heinz.
Authorities recommended limiting groups to fewer than 250 people. Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., decided his auditoriums would cap capacity at 50% even if they sat fewer than 500 people. AMC rewrote its ticketing software so moviegoers received a ""Sold Out"" message when that threshold was hit.
Doug McMillon was in a meeting in Walmart's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters when he got a call from the White House. The Walmart CEO stepped out of the room to return the call.
Jared Kushner said the White House wanted Walmart to marshal its resources, along with other retailers, to help build a broader Covid-19 testing network. The spread of the virus was stretching the government's ability to test patients. Retailers like Walmart had thousands of pharmacists who might be able to administer tests in their parking lots.
The next day, Mr. McMillon flew to Washington for a televised press briefing in the Rose Garden, along with other retail CEOs and members of the president's coronavirus task force.
Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, opening access to as much as $50 billion in financial assistance for states, localities and territories. ""No resource will be spared,"" the president said.
The president called the Walmart CEO to the lectern.
It was ""an out-of-body experience,"" Mr. McMillon told colleagues afterward of speaking to the nation. At the end of brief remarks, the CEO turned to walk away but Mr. Trump reached out for a handshake.
The CDC had urged people for days to avoiding touching, at the risk of spreading germs. If the president wants to shake hands, you shake hands, Mr. McMillon thought. Chiding messages streamed into the CEO's phone. In the pocket of his suit jacket was a miniature bottle of Purell.

In New York, Wall Street veteran Joe Amato woke up at 3 a.m. to check on Asian markets and never made it back to bed.
The president of Neuberger Berman Group LLC, a money manager with $350 billion in assets, had gone to sleep unsure where Wall Street was headed. The day before not only stock indexes close 10% lower but also Treasury yields rise -- two contradictory moves that spooked him.
Futures were down early Friday morning but not by as much as feared. He thought the market might be snapping back. Traffic was light heading in to the firm's Midtown office before sunrise. One of his senior managers noted his cab driver told him he'd been his first fare in three hours.
The virus had begun to disrupt daily life far from Sixth Avenue, where Neuberger employees typically elbow through crowds of Broadway-goers.
Cities were closing schools. Across the nation, lines snaked out the door for stores that sell groceries and other home supplies.
Smart & Final Stores Inc.'s previous daily sales record was the day before Thanksgiving 2018. That day, the food retailer doubled it. CEO Dave Hirz sent any available employee from its Los Angeles headquarters -- those not mired in supply-chain hell -- to restock shelves and help scrub down stores.
Mr. Hirz would soon put in orders for plexiglass screens to protect cashiers from customers and vice versa.
In his office, Mr. Amato and his colleagues watched the stock market turn abruptly during the Rose Garden briefing. The Dow gained 9.4% that day. Neuberger decided it still needed to keep some staff in the office to monitor the swings.
The market gyrations of the week reminded Mr. Amato of the panic he felt in 2008, when he was a senior executive at Lehman Brothers. There was one exception: People weren't worrying about dying in the 2008 crisis.
Saturday, March 14
The world's biggest retailer, with more than two million workers and $500 billion in global revenue, had dealt with hurricanes and floods. This was different. It was the entire system under stress.
John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., reviewed the inventory coming in the door versus sales going out. His team discussed closing down some stores to direct supplies to bigger locations.
They decided to keep all stories open but close them at night -- many are normally open 24 hours -- to disinfect and restock shelves. The next week, Walmart said it needed to hire 150,000 temporary workers to keep up with the demand.
Ms. Grossman, the WW CEO, called her executives to discuss the changes they needed to make. WW was closing all 3,000 studios, the storefronts where members had gathered for decades to weigh in and share their progress.
She spent five hours on a conference call working out how to create virtual studios and train 12,000 coaches to use streaming technologies. ""We were not going to leave these people without support,"" she said.
Ms. Grossman was in Florida for her granddaughter Hannah's baby naming ceremony. She missed much of it, locked in the nursery on the phone.
Sunday, March 15
MGM's board met via conference call. Officials in some states had begun ordering casinos to close, but no such order had been handed down yet in Nevada. Crowds still wandered the Strip that weekend.
Mr. Hornbuckle presented a plan to close down in 72 hours. The board pressed him to move faster. They settled on closing casinos in 24 hours and the hotels in 48. They'd been through this before -- shutting Mandalay Bay after the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting and closing Mississippi properties in Hurricane Katrina -- but never at this scale.
On a conference call with Mr. Trump, White House officials and food industry executives, Cargill's Mr. MacLennan urged the USDA to ensure there would be enough inspectors for meat plants to continue operating. Around that time, Cargill recorded the first Covid-19 case among its employees.
Adrenaline kept Mr. MacLennan going. Hearing radio reports about orders to close restaurants, he wondered whether people would ever pack them again. Scenes of students partying on Florida beaches over spring break seemed weirdly out of place.
""It was like one domino after another fell,"" he said.
To clear his head, Mr. MacLennan went running in his neighborhood and rode a Peloton cycle. His family instituted a new dinnertime rule: No Covid-19 discussions. ""The boss can't have a bad day,"" he said.
Monday, March 16
The online orders were pouring in, ballooning to 10-times peak volumes at Rite Aid Corp.'s e-commerce warehouses.
""Tens of thousands of dollars in one order, buying up everything,"" said Heyward Donigan, the drugstore chain's CEO. She had been on the job less than seven months. Ramping up online sales was on her to-do list. But not like this.
Rite Aid's online team set quotas on high-demand items like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. ""We want everyone to have the opportunity to get at least something,"" Ms. Donigan thought.
At 7 a.m., AMC said it would cap attendance in its theaters at 50 people. Mr. Aron had learned about the revised government guidelines, down from 250 people, the night before. Within hours there was a new recommendation from health officials: Limit gatherings to 10 people.
Mr. Aron saw little choice. AMC's 635 U.S. locations wouldn't open as of Tuesday. More than 30,000 showtimes scheduled for that day were canceled.
""How can you be socially responsible and stay open?"" Mr. Aron asked himself.
By the next day, the three largest theater chains -- AMC, Regal Entertainment and Cinemark -- had closed operations.
The stock market was tanking, but John Schlifske, CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in America, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., wasn't alarmed.
A 32-year veteran of the company, he had worked since January on a plan to stash away cash in the insurer's $250 billion investment portfolio and scoop up bargains in the downdraft he saw as inevitable.
Only a small fraction of Northwestern Mutual's money is in the stock market in normal times. Most is in ultrasafe bonds, whose interest goes to pay out insurance claims. By the end of the week, the firm had added more than $1 billion worth of stocks and high-yield bonds. The buying binge steered clear of hospitality companies he figured would be hardest-hit by the virus.
Over the occasional bark from his German shepherd and interruption from one of his four teenagers, Mr. Schlifske took calls from financial advisers looking for guidance to reassure any panicky clients.
""We're buying right now,"" he told them. ""Our company is 160 years old. We've seen pandemics. We've seen depressions.""

David Solomon, the chief of Goldman Sachs, had become his own barista. He used to swing by the Starbucks near his bank's downtown Manhattan headquarters, but now he was making his preferred drink at his SoHo apartment.
The Wall Street veteran took four shots of decaf espresso and almond milk, over ice, and poured it into a Yeti supercooling mug. He dialed his chief financial officer, Stephen Scherr.
""Do it,"" he said. Borrow $1 billion from the federal government.
Goldman and seven other big banks had decided to take the plunge together, borrowing from the Fed's ""discount window"" --- an emergency fund that was last used at size during the 2008 crisis. None needed the money, but they might before this was over. By doing it now, they would rid the exercise of stigma.
A few hours later, the money landed at Goldman's account at the New York Fed.
FedEx executives gathered in a war room in a four-story Memphis office building, each sitting 6 feet away from the next.
After markets closed, finance chief Alan Graf told investors FedEx was withdrawing its financial forecasts, the first time in the company's 50-year history. It was a move that dozens of other major companies from Ford to Domino's Pizza Inc. would soon make.
The next evening, the head of human resources called Mr. Smith, the CEO, at his home with the news he knew was coming: An employee in that building had tested positive for Covid-19. Mr. Smith ordered all employees to work from home, and commissioned a thorough cleaning. He was back in the office on Sunday for a TV interview.
Running out of financing options, Boeing turned to the federal government to ask for taxpayer help. The plane maker had already drawn down a $13.8 billion loan. It wanted at least $60 billion for itself, its suppliers and the broader aerospace sector.
The request emerged from discussions top Boeing leaders had with Trump administration officials as plans for a stimulus package took shape. It spurred the resignation of director Nikki Haley, surprising senior company leaders.
Wednesday, March 18
Mr. Stephenson was scanning a list of AT&T's retail stores, trying to figure out which to close. Some had to stay open; AT&T runs a network that gives priority access to first responders -- and they needed cellphones.
""Nobody should have to drive more than 30 minutes to get to us"" he told his No. 2, John Stankey. They cross-referenced locations and population data and figured they could make do with about one-third of stores open. They closed the rest and ordered more hand sanitizer for ones staying open.
That night Mr. Stephenson toggled between CNN, which he owns, and ""The West Wing,"" which he'd been bingeing in his scarce downtime.
Mr. Amato, Neuberger's president, was one of only a handful of employees in the investment firm's Manhattan headquarters. He spent it watching the market tumble again.
Mr. Amato recorded a video for his own employees, sharing the firm's money managers' views on the markets and the economy. He took a car back to his New Jersey home for a quiet dinner with his family. It was his 58th birthday.
Thursday, March 19
Arne Sorenson was near tears as he shared the news with employees. It was the first time many of them had seen their boss since he had started treatment for pancreatic cancer in 2019. He was bald and gaunt. His shirt gaped at the collar.
""I have never had a more difficult moment than this one,"" the CEO of Marriott, the world's biggest hotel operator, said in a video to his staff.
Marriott's business had fallen 75%, a plunge steeper than the post-Sept. 11 period and financial crisis combined. The company would be furloughing nearly all its workers.
The sudden evaporation of travel wiped out in a matter of weeks all the profits many hotel companies piled up. On March 19, the U.S. warned Americans against all international travel. Marriott executives were scrambling to close down hotels and cut as many costs as possible.
""Covid-19 is like nothing we have ever seen before,"" Mr. Sorenson told his staff. ""For a company that is 92 years old, that has borne witness to the Great Depression, World War II and many other economic and global crises, that's saying something.""
Pfizer researchers dialed in from their workstations, demarcated by fresh circles of yellow paint on the floor. ""I want a vaccine in six months,"" Mr. Bourla, the CEO, told them. Even if the virus quieted over the summer, it would likely be back in the fall. Oct. 1 was their deadline for a process that usually takes years.
The 58-year-old tried to deliver the same rallying cry in person at a Massachusetts plant that churns out Pfizer's blood-clotting drugs. The plant manager told him he was nonessential and deactivated his pass.
Mr. Bourla sent a video message instead and gave them a week to come up with a plan to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses. ""If not us,"" he said, ""Who?""
Directors at tobacco giant Altria Group Inc. dialed in by phone in the afternoon to learn the latest: Altria's chairman and CEO, Howard Willard, had tested positive for the coronavirus. The 56-year-old wasn't well enough to be on the call.
Billy Gifford, Altria's finance chief, would take the reins temporarily. As a 26-year veteran of the company, he knew the business and had been part of the board's succession planning before the crisis.
He would be working from quarantine, because Mr. Gifford, like other members of the leadership team, had come in contact with his boss before they had all begun to work from home.
There was more: Mr. Gifford told the board that two employees from Altria's cigarette business had tested positive. The factory where Marlboros are made would shut for two weeks. The company had a two-month inventory of cigarettes on hand.
Friday, March 20
Baristas at Starbucks flooded online chat forums, sharing concerns about still having to serve the public as the virus spread. Thousands signed an online petition for the company to close its stores, and threatened a walkout the following Monday.
Around 4 p.m. in Seattle, the company said it would close nearly all of its company-owned U.S. cafes, keeping its drive-thrus open and switching to delivery. It promised to pay baristas for 30 days whether they showed up for work or not.
Mr. Johnson, the CEO, said the actions weren't prompted by the boycott threats by employees, nor was he aware of them at the time. ""There was a realization that this would come at a cost, but it was based on principle,"" he said.
The next morning, he woke up at 5 a.m. to meditate, worried that employees wouldn't show up in sufficient numbers. A few hours later, one of his lieutenants texted: Of the stores that the company determined could safely open, 95% did.
Lineage Logistics, America's biggest cold storage company, moved its U.S. warehouses from two breaks per shift to six to thin out break rooms.
Masking-tape X's on the floor ensured social distancing. Any violation of the 6-feet rule would be entered into Lineage's safety log as a ""near miss,"" the same designation required by federal workplace-safety regulations when a forklift barely avoids hitting someone.
Greg Lehmkuhl, Lineage's CEO, knew enough to take the virus seriously. He had gotten sick 48 hours after returning from a trip to Amsterdam in February. The 47-year-old sweated through towels at night and dialed into a Feb. 25 board meeting shivering in front of the fireplace in his Detroit home.
His wife made him nachos, slathered with hot sauce that he couldn't taste, a side effect of Covid-19. There were no tests, but he assumed he was infected.
In California, Mr. Hirz, the Smart & Final grocery-chain CEO, replaced the copy in the weekly flier. Instead of price specials, he placed help-wanted ads. He told his store managers they could hire on the spot, skipping background and drug checks.
Sunday, March 22
Uber bookings plunged as the month progressed. The company's thousands of gig workers demanded broader employment protections. Uber had agreed on March 6 to compensate drivers infected or quarantined with up to two weeks of missed pay. Rival Lyft Inc. followed.
Mr. Khosrowshahi spent the weekend calling more than a dozen congressmen appealing that his drivers be covered for assistance under the stimulus package. It culminated in a letter to the president.
Monday, March 23
Mr. Ackman, the hedge-fund manager, phoned into a board meeting of Howard Hughes, the real-estate developer where he is chairman. A month earlier, he had told the company's management to model out what would happen if they had to close their Houston hotels and the South Street Seaport restaurant and bar area in New York City; both had now happened.
The models showed the company could run dangerously low on money by the end of the year. Mr. Ackman agreed to invest $500 million. By week's end, bankers wrangled another $100 million from outside investors. Howard Hughes had more than $1 billion of cash to see it through.
Boeing said it would suspend Seattle-area plane production for two weeks. As the month dragged on, more and more Boeing employees tested positive for Covid-19, many of them at its Everett, Wash., factory. Several hundred wound up in quarantine. One factory worker died from suspected complications from the illness.
Tuesday, March 24
Mr. Corbat, the Citigroup chief, decamped to his home. Until then, he had stayed put in the company's nearly deserted headquarters. He first had to get his own technology in order: His son and daughter-in-law were staying at the home, and bandwidth was running low. He ordered more routers and deputized his son, Brian, as tech support.
After weeks of war gaming, Mr. Wirth had made his decision. Chevron would ax $4 billion from its budget, a 20% reduction, stop buying back its shares and reduce oil production in its U.S. shale fields. Layoffs loomed.
He announced the decision in a video to his 45,000 employees that day, remembering the advice of past Chevron leaders to constantly communicate. ""If you have bad news, don't beat around the bush,"" he thought.
Wednesday, March 25
""There aren't enough products to go around,"" said Dan Florness, chief executive of Fastenal Co., a distributor of industrial equipment including mission-critical items such as safety goggles, respirators and gloves.
He decided to cut off some of the company's longtime manufacturing and construction customers on safety-related items to focus on supplying health-care companies and first responders. Some customers complained.
""I'm worried about our economy, the safety of our society,"" he said. ""I'm worried about my 90-year-old mom and my family.""
Friday, March 27
Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion rescue plan, the largest relief package in U.S. history. It extended aid to millions of Americans through direct payments and expanded unemployment benefits. It also provided loans and grants to small and big businesses, including beleaguered hospitals and airlines.
The surging number of coronavirus infections left hospitals short on masks for health care workers and ventilators for
patients. Mr. Trump ordered General Motors Co. to produce ventilators.
Monday, March 30
Gap Inc. and Kohl's Corp. followed Macy's in saying they would furlough the majority of their employees and extend store closures.
The Macy's board had met by phone on Friday, March 27. Executives felt the stimulus package's aid to unemployed workers combined with Macy's decision to continue paying health benefits would provide a cushion for employees.
Mr. Gennette, the CEO, had originally hoped stores would reopen by April 1. As the virus spread, it became clear that wasn't going to happen.
They also looked at what happened in countries that had started to recover such as China and South Korea. Rather than a burst of pent-up demand, shoppers were coming back slowly. Mr. Gennette realized that when stores reopened, they might come back with lower sales.
Macy's moves helped it cut its cash burn rate by half. Mr. Gennette and his team turned to seeking rent relief from landlords and refinancing debt.
""What we are doing in a day are decisions that used to take us weeks,"" the CEO said. ""It's coming at us so fast.""
Goldman's Mr. Solomon watched from the 41st floor as the U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort floated into New York harbor. ""Here comes the cavalry,"" he said to no one, and snapped a photo.
Tuesday, March 31
United canceled more than 70% of its flights on the last day of the month, and those that did take off were just 15% full on average. The airline carried 30,000 passengers that day, compared with the roughly 600,000 it would typically fly at this time of year.
Mr. Kirby was starting at around 4:30 a.m. and going for runs. With the airline's Chicago office closed, he was spending most of his day on the phone walking around his Dallas neighborhood on call after call. He logged about 25,000 steps a day. ""I spend the whole time trying to figure out how to keep my phone charged,"" he said.
Mr. Hirz, the grocery CEO, was relieved to see canned vegetables on the shelves. Strolling around one of his stores in Montebello, Calif., it was the first time that aisle was fully stocked in weeks. The only worry sign was a shortage of 10-pound bags of potatoes.
At the other end of the food-supply chain, Conagra raised its revenue forecasts. Initially, executives thought the spike in demand would last for a week or two, and then shoppers would have hoarded enough to fill their pantries and freezers. That didn't happen.
Conagra's factories were running seven days a week. Because people have been stuck at home, they were going through the food they bought and going back to the store to stock up on more. In the four weeks that ended March 22, Conagra's retail sales and shipments each rose about 50%.
How long will it last? ""It's just not possible to predict,"" Mr. Connolly said.
Uber anticipates an 80% year-over-year decline in its rides business for as long as the pandemic goes on. The company is encouraging its drivers to become food-delivery carriers. Mr. Khosrowshahi is also calling other CEOs to ask if they can hire them. ""March has been a blur,"" he said.
At Citigroup, Mr. Corbat's dashboard, which spits out up-to-the-minute stats on the bank's global empire, showed a splintered organization.
The headquarters building, which typically hosts 12,800 people, had just 400 in it. Half came from cleaning, security and operations. Instead, 120,000 people were logged in remotely.
New York City was now the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. It ended the month with more than 40,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.
That evening, in the final hours of March, Mr. Trump held a press conference and promised ""we will prevail, we will win.""
He added: ""This could be a hell of a bad two weeks. This is going to be a very bad two, and maybe even three weeks. This is going to be three weeks like we haven't seen before.""

| Jump to first hitAfter losing her husband on the eve of a pandemic, she anticipated despair but found resilience. Here's why.The wall must have moved into the doorway when I wasn't looking, and I walked straight into it as I was rushing out of the kitchen. I had just burned my thumb on the oven rack while pulling out a casserole, having forgotten it was hot. (This was before the pandemic but after the funeral.)What are the chances that becoming widowed on the eve of a pandemic and practicing self-isolation in grief will give me some perspective on life and death? Or, put another way, will I survive?Dinners without him are terrible, the worst time to heat a casserole and touch hot oven racks -- though practically speaking, weren't casseroles invented for giving to widows to heat as their solitary dinners?He and I didn't eat casseroles. We preferred steak, some fish, a chicken, a chop. Oh, we loved our lamb chops. Like Jack Sprat and his wife, he couldn't eat the fat along the rib, while I devoured it. He didn't like the marrow in Osso Bucco, either. How lucky to be married to someone who left all the good bits for me. Did I ever think that while he was alive?When we met, he was leaning against a wall at a party. Dark brows, dark eyes, his head inclined to the girl next to him. He looked like just the kind of bad boy I was partial to, all smoldering looks and banked fires. And I was a little drunk, so I went over there.[ Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships. ]""Do you mind if I ask your fiancé to dance?"" I asked the girl.She shrugged. ""He's not mine,"" she said. ""Go for it.""He was a Brooklyn boy, back in town from the army, from Korea. On our first date, he smelled like camphor balls, and a moth flew out of his jacket pocket.I was a Bronx girl with literary pretensions, and I read everything I could get my hands on, good and bad, high and low, about love. I wrote poems and fantasized endlessly about those strict, strong, brooding men, like Heathcliff, Mr. Rochester or Rhett Butler.But I found out that his silences, and those piercing eyes that fooled me into thinking of dangerous love and dramatic heartbreak, were not who he was at all. His eyes were simply beautiful, and his silence wasn't fierce; he just didn't have anything to say at the moment. He wasn't a bad boy. He was a quiet man. Yet his kisses did taste like vanilla, and I began to feel that the unspoken could be as sexy as the withheld. So, we got married.I have to tell you, our prospects were not good. We had nothing in common. We didn't know how to argue. I made noise; he stayed silent. We didn't seem to want the same kind of life. I was a show-off; he kept a low profile. I had ambitions, while he only had exigencies to ""make a living."" To support me, he would have said (since we were the postwar generation, when husbands took care of their wives, and the wives were grateful). By the time I knew the phrase ""passive aggressive"" and he knew pretentiousness when he saw it, we had two children.In the '70s, no-fault divorce, the sexual revolution and feminism were in the news, and marriage breakups were common, if not rampant. He was still struggling to make a living selling medical equipment. I was writing and working in a bookstore, with Doris Lessing, Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Simone de Beauvoir & co.I thought about life without him. I thought about redecorating my life with brighter colors, a more adventurous style, even another man, one with perhaps more wit, more words. (The night he went out ""for a long walk"" and took the car, I was pretty sure he was thinking about it, too.) But as taxing as his habitual silence could be, there were certain things I had come to value and was not willing to give up. He was a great friend. A great father. A kind man who helped anyone who needed helping.So we made our way through the '80s. He started his own business and we felt the pressures of that and of raising two teenagers. But by then I had developed a taste for quietude, and he discovered he could make me laugh.When it looked as though my first book would be published, I worried that it would disturb the equilibrium of our union. Would his ego be able to take it? What would it do us? I think I would have backed off, but he said not to be afraid. His ego didn't work that way, he said. He might not read what I wrote, but he knew it was good. He was behind me all the way.Life was sweet in the '90s. I was teaching and there was room in our life for me to write and find my way as a writer. My second book was published. He joined a medical supply company that sent him all over the world. We had some money and a nice car. Sometimes he took me with him. Sometimes he brought home gifts. And stories.He knew how I loved stories, and he brought me stories. On Sunday mornings when he was home, from early March through October, we would sit outside on our little city patio and read the newspaper and have our coffee. A neighbor once said it gave her pleasure to see us there, quiet, in harmony, together.In 2000, he retired from his position as director of international sales, and I left my teaching job at the City University, and we settled in Woodstock, in our vacation house, where we built a life, made friends, worked, volunteered. We got sick and better many times; he took care of me and I took care of him. Our children and grandchildren came to visit. We got a dog, Pete, so we would walk more; I walked Pete in the morning, and he walked him in the afternoon.I cooked. He did most of the driving and paid the bills. Once in a while (after he had a heart attack) he would say, ""Come here, let me show you what I'm doing."" But I didn't want to see, knowing he was preparing me for when I might have to do it on my own. He brought me coffee in bed every morning.Six months ago, things got serious with his heart. Three months ago, I began bringing him his coffee in bed and started doing both the dog walks and driving him to and from doctors. I also took over doing some of the other things, such as collecting the week's trash and hauling the big cans down to the end of the road. And I had let him show me where the water shut-off valve was in the garage. But I hadn't let him teach me to pay bills, so he kept doing those, breathing with effort.He was winding down and we knew it. Here's the thing: We talked about it and didn't talk about it. He had learned to say some things and I had learned not to talk so much. When he felt a pain or a twinge, and I would see it in his face and say, ""What?"" he would say, ""Nothing."" For me. When he closed his eyes in the middle of the conversation and fell asleep, I didn't wake him; I waited for him.We kept up what we could. He didn't have the breath to walk the dog anymore, but we drove to the market, and while I went in and shopped, he stood outside with Pete. He wasn't very hungry, but we kept our dinner hour. We had a cocktail whether it was tomato juice or a beer, or, if he felt like it, a small scotch. We clinked our glasses and talked about the past, and laughed and held hands, and talked about the ""future"" and how we were going to get ourselves to a beach as soon as he felt better.We said our wish would be to end together, just like this.

The panicked phone calls began in early March.

They came from the adult children of several of my patients, worried that mom and dad, like many in their generation, were blithely disregarding the growing clamor for social distancing and putting themselves at risk.

""Life must go on!"" one patient, a war veteran and widower, had told his son, explaining why he refused to stay at home.

As the numbers of deaths from Covid-19 quickly rose, and more people began to hunker down, I started getting fewer of these calls. Even the war veteran by this point had retreated into the safer confines of his apartment.

Then the second wave of calls started. And it hasn't stopped.

These callers range in age from their 30s to their 80s and older. And, regardless of age, everyone is scared. Scared of losing something—their lives, or livelihood, or just the many simple pleasures of daily life that we've all taken for granted.

But while fear may be a common denominator, it's the differences among generations that are even more pronounced, and more worrisome. Under stress, we make mental calculations and considerations based on our own mind-sets, as if everyone thinks the same way. Under stress, we tend to speak to and not with each other.

Nowhere has this been clearer to me than when I listen to the conversations across generations. In those moments, we often speak very different languages—call them fortyish, sixtyish and eightyish—in which the words may be the same but the meanings aren't. The resulting misunderstandings limit how much emotional support we can give and receive from others, only increasing our psychological stress.

As a psychiatrist, I spend my time trying to learn these languages. If we can speak the same language, we can better communicate our fears, needs and strengths to one another. And if we can do that, we can go a long way toward relieving so much of the intense stress and tension that we are all feeling in a time of lockdowns and illness.

Fortyish

Although most people in their 30s to 50s perceive themselves as generally safe even if infected, many were startled to realize that their older loved ones weren't only the most vulnerable to severe illness and death, but were even labeled as expendable in certain quarters.

Suddenly, these speakers of fortyish—many of whom had distant or limited relationships with their elders—saw their responsibilities as going beyond merely serving as an occasional drop-by driver, porter or tech support. They were now protectors, especially of those who they imagined were skirting rules in ways that seemed as crazy and irresponsible as the hordes of spring-breakers crowding the Florida beaches.

This new role explains many of the behaviors I have observed in speakers of fortyish toward older loved ones. I have seen frantic concerns—""You left the house and went where today?!""—over what they perceive as cavalier attitudes toward keeping safe. I have seen short tempers and exasperation over having to help them set up Zoom conferences or navigate the intricacies of smartphone apps or internet shopping. The fortyish speakers lecture, cajole, threaten and sometimes scream at the older individuals they feel responsible to guide and protect.

Beneath the screams, of course, what they are saying is, ""I care about you"" and ""I want you to live."" As obvious as these translated phrases appear, though, they have often been left unspoken. Perhaps that is why they aren't understood and even resented. Would you want to be told repeatedly how foolish you are?

Sixtyish

Many boomers in their late 50s through 70s—speakers of sixtyish—began the pandemic with a similar mind-set as their fortyish-speaking family and friends, focused on the responsibilities of caring for themselves and particularly their elders. After all, this is a generation that prides itself on its vitality and energy and independence, and is used to taking care of both their parents and their kids.

The pandemic, though, has undercut so much of what boomers think of themselves. For one thing, being cut off from family, friends or communities has amplified pre- and postretirement fears of being left without a purpose or plan. I have seen and heard from many speakers of sixtyish who are struggling with this strange gap in time, not certain, or able, to connect in a satisfying way with children, friends or parents. It has been hard for them to acknowledge the true dependence on others that has been revealed by the pandemic, not just for toilet paper or groceries but also for basic human contact.

But perhaps more than anything else, many speakers of sixtyish have been shocked by the fact that when health experts speak of older age as a risk factor for more serious illness or death, they are referring to them! These speakers of sixtyish were the younger generation of the not-so-distant past. With another 30 to 40 years of life ahead, they think of themselves as still in their prime, and have been conditioned to project their own fears about sickness or isolation onto their younger and older loved ones, rather than focusing on themselves. The pandemic has stripped away this defense, laying bare their own vulnerability.

Eightyish

The oldest generation represents a wave of individuals in their late 70s to 90s who never existed in such numbers before. Many of these speakers of eightyish are content to have earned some years of retirement, and they intend to make the best of them. Not surprisingly, then, some of them initially interpreted ""social distancing"" as a potentially permanent end to all of the activities and personal, face-to-face connections that give meaning to their lives—lives that they know may not have all that much time left.

Unlike younger generations, speakers of eightyish tend not to be as quick to turn to texting, video chats or Netflix to fill their hours. Many thrive on routines that are simple yet critical: coffee at the same diner; dominoes every Tuesday night; meeting every week to talk, laugh or pray with their circle of friends. Why stop all of that for another dagger hanging over them? Today it's coronavirus, tomorrow a stroke or cancer.

For someone already living in the shadow of life's end, the world looks quite different. Any seeming recklessness on this group's part in the early days of the pandemic was never like the foolish or impulsive behaviors of a teen who doesn't appreciate the risk. It was, rather, the determined behavior of someone who is accepting of the perceived risk because it's now or never to complete one's most important life tasks and goals.

And contrary to our macabre and ageist stereotypes, most healthy aging minds are neither depressed nor disabled. Rather, they grow more hopeful and practical with age, and exert considerable effort binding our families and communities together with their wisdom and creativity, especially during times of natural disaster. It is not surprising that several of the key leaders during the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci among them, come from this generation.

Many of those speaking eightyish do understand the meaning of a deadly pandemic (despite what their children believe), but without the same urgent fears that younger generations might be feeling. Older brains are less impulsive, less emotionally reactive. Contrary to the stereotype that fragile older minds crumble in the face of stress, the average older person is surprisingly resilient, drawing upon a lifetime of experience, knowledge and social connections.

Talking Across Generations

How do these different languages play out day to day? In our current strange world of confinement and worry, the conversations between generations have become more frequent and fraught with misunderstanding. Even the most banal topics—How do we get groceries? How should we communicate? When will it be safe to go out?—are like at the Tower of Babel after everyone's tongues were struck with different languages. We end up frustrated, angry, disconnected and even more stressed out than before. It's just another pernicious effect of this virus.

But it doesn't have to be that way. Let me share several strategies that can improve intergenerational interactions.


Begin with questions. In some ways this is the hardest thing to do, because most of us want to talk in these trying times. So here is my most crucial bit of advice: When talking to others—and especially with somebody from a different generation—put aside your agenda, no matter how urgent or necessary it seems, and commit yourself to learning more about them. Ask questions about how they are feeling and coping, what they need, and how they perceive the impact of the pandemic on their life. Listen to the answers without having to immediately respond with your own perspective.

This approach gives speakers of fortyish the time to explain the practical and technological solutions so often needed. It encourages speakers of sixtyish to voice underlying fears of mortality and dependence. And it will tap into lifetimes of experience from those speakers of eightyish who can provide needed perspective for younger generations panicked over the pandemic's threat to their health, careers and retirement plans.


Be Patient: If there is one currency to this pandemic, it is the time to sit in the presence of others, either eyeball to eyeball in our households or on a video chat, or ear to ear on the phone. We've never before had such a luxury of time to do that, yet we still need to remind ourselves to breathe slower and be more patient listeners. It's tempting to hear just enough from one another to enable us to launch into our own opinions or truths or whatever thoughts help us feel in control, but in doing so we cut each other off too quickly.

We are all struggling to find answers, small and large, but there isn't a rush. Each generational language has its own power and truth, and given time it will emerge with clarity.

It's a reminder to speakers of fortyish that older generations really can learn to use the digital technology that others take for granted, but need time to shake the analog cobwebs from their minds.

Speakers of sixtyish can learn to be more patient with themselves and realize that their voices and skills can be translated into effective ways to give and receive support across the stay-at-home divide; they just need to accept that younger people can help them make that transition.

Speakers of eightyish offer powerful coping skills, such as taking the long view and realizing that life will emerge from this, but they need help getting their voices out. These oldest among us are too often silent, because they are neither wired nor brought into the conversation, and because they are viewed as actual or potential victims to pity and protect but not engage. That's a huge missed opportunity for the rest of us.


Be Empathic: Asking questions and taking the time to listen will transport us into the shoes of others. This will activate our inborn trait of empathy to really experience the generational mind-sets of others and get inside their languages. For speakers of fortyish, feelings of worry and occasional exasperation can be tempered with new respect and even awe for the lifelong accumulation of experience and wisdom in those older. Speakers of sixtyish can better understand not only the needs but the capabilities of those younger and older than themselves, which can enrich conversations in ways that give them feelings of purpose and support. Empathy also will help speakers of eightyish to better translate the urgent words of concern and sometimes panic in younger voices into a powerful and reassuring expression of love and protection.

These approaches are a good start, and will enable all of us to better understand what the other person is intending to say, not just in this time of fear and uncertainly, but in the future, when the pandemic ends and we still have to talk with one another across generations.

Let us seize the opportunity now to make a difference that will leave at least one positive legacy from this otherwise devastating scourge. With time, patience and mutual interest, our words to one another can begin to make sense.

We just have to listen.

Middle-class Americans are forsaking marriage amid financial insecurity, effectively making the institution more of a luxury good enjoyed by prosperous Americans.
The middle three-fifths of U.S. earners have experienced the sharpest declines in marriage rates over the past four decades compared with people at the bottom of the income ladder and those at the top, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of census data from 1980 to 2018, the most recent available. These households earned from $25,000 to $125,000 in 2018.
Affluent Americans who marry are more likely to pool six-figure incomes, buy homes and watch their assets grow. Among people ages 25 to 34, the median wealth of married couples is four times that of couples who live together but aren't married, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The divide reflects another facet of the nation's income gap.
More couples are deciding to live together instead of marrying, and strained finances are a top reason many cite. A survey last year by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that among those who live with a partner and wish to get married, more than half said they or their partner weren't financially ready.
""Economic conditions, even in the good economy, remain difficult for many working Americans,"" said Daniel Schneider, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied marriage. ""That is not conducive to you feeling like you could get married, or people wanting to marry you.""
Marriage remains a goal for most young Americans. Every year since 1976, University of Michigan researchers have asked high-school seniors across the U.S. whether they expect to marry: Three-quarters of them said yes in 2017, a share virtually unchanged since the first survey, according to an analysis by Bowling Green State University of the survey data.

Now, many young adults no longer see marriage as the first rung on the ladder to adulthood. Instead, they want to first start careers, or at least land secure jobs and have some money in their pocket.
""The meaning of marriage has changed, and marriage is now viewed as this capstone achievement once all of these other milestones have been achieved,"" said Susan L. Brown, chair of sociology at Bowling Green State. ""It's almost like a luxury good that's attainable only by the people who have the highest resources in society.""
About half of middle earners were married in 2018, a drop of 16 percentage points since 1980. Among the highest U.S. earners, 60% were married in 2018, a decline of 4 percentage points over the same period. That marks a reversal. In 1980, a higher proportion of middle-class Americans than top earners were married.
The poorest Americans, those with incomes under $25,000, remain the least likely to marry, but their marriage rates haven't budged since 2005.
Stagnant wages and lost manufacturing jobs, especially since the financial crisis, have eroded the financial security that helped previous generations of working-class Americans form married households, researchers said.
Nick Cotter, 31 years old, grew up in Pittsburgh's Brookline neighborhood. His father was an electrician, and his mother worked raising four children. The family usually went to Catholic Church services at least twice a week.
Mr. Cotter faced bleak prospects after finishing high school in 2007. He worked as a supermarket stock boy at minimum wage until he was 21. He tried college before dropping out, in part because he couldn't afford it.

Did finances play a role in your decision to marry or not to marry?Join the conversation below.
His low-skill, low-wage job wasn't conducive to dating, much less marriage, he said: ""When you don't feel that good about yourself, you definitely don't think other people will think that much of you.""
He took a second crack at college and received a bachelor's degree from Wheeling University in West Virginia in 2013. He eventually got a master's degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon University. He now works as a local government researcher on affordable housing and neighborhoods.
Mr. Cotter is hopeful he will find the right partner. ""I feel like if I ever get married it would probably be because of the tax benefits, or if they really wanted to,"" he said. ""That's a definite change from what my parents thought.""
Diploma divide
The marriage gap by education level is also widening.
The share of high-school-educated adults who are married has fallen 19 percentage points since 1980, while declining 8 percentage points for those with a four-year degree, the Journal found. Among Americans ages 25 and older, nearly two-thirds with a college degree are married, compared with just half of those with a high-school education or less.
Couples living together are under less pressure from family and friends to tie the knot than in the past. The steady decline in mainstream religion helped remove the stigma once assigned unmarried couples living together.
More couples are forming families without matrimony. One in four parents living with a child is unmarried, according to Pew. More than one-third of them are living with a partner, up from one in five in 1997, the Pew study of 2017 data found.
Some churches are expanding marriage-support services over concerns that falling rates of matrimony are a main reason fewer people go to church.
""Family decline is what's driving faith decline,"" said J.P. De Gance, president and chief executive of Communio, a nonprofit in Alexandria, Va. The group helps churches build ministries that encourage healthy marriages and relationships.
The shadow of divorce might also play a role. People born from 1965 to 1980, Generation X, as well as millennials, born from 1981 to 1996, grew up in the era when such breakups became common. Their childhood experiences sowed cynicism about marriage for some, experts said. The U.S. divorce rate, after peaking in 1979, is now at a 40-year low.
The decline in marriage has been pronounced in metropolitan areas where manufacturing jobs have dried up, places such as Janesville, Wis.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Utica, N.Y.; and Bangor, Maine.

David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and co-authors studied areas in the U.S. hurt by China's economic rise. They determined that job losses shrank the supply of economically secure young adult men, spurring a decline in marriage and childbearing.
One explanation is that the diminished economic power of men makes them less likely to marry and, driving this dynamic, the men may be less motivated to work because they aren't married. That was the subject of a paper published last year by Ariel Binder and John Bound of the University of Michigan economics department. They looked at a decadeslong decline in labor-force participation among men in their prime working years without college degrees.
Mr. Binder said these men, anticipating a worse marriage market, may not work as hard because they don't see themselves helping support a wife and family.
Meanwhile, their most-likely marriage partners, women without a college degree, have closed the earnings gap with male peers even faster than women with higher levels of education, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The earnings shift has reduced the economic motivation for these women to marry. ""The whole notion of a commitment device to keep the high-earning men around is not as crucial,"" said Shelly Lundberg, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Financial ties
In Decatur, Ill., where the number of manufacturing jobs has declined 40% since 2000, barely half of high-school-educated people age 25 and older are married, down from 60% in 2000.
Jeanette Dlouhy, a 36-year-old emergency-room technician, and Troy Pulliam, a 43-year-old drug counselor, moved in together in 2018.
They said they want to get married but are holding off because Ms. Dlouhy is enrolled in a publicly funded program that pays for her to earn a nursing license. Combining their income could jeopardize that assistance, she said, as well as her state health-insurance subsidies.
""I don't think I could feed my kids if I didn't get help,"" she said.

Ms. Dlouhy is twice divorced with five children. She earned good grades in high school and dreamed of becoming a lawyer but never followed through with college. Mr. Pulliam is a divorced father of three. He had a series of skilled manufacturing jobs before becoming a drug counselor. She makes $13.25 an hour. He makes $20 an hour.
Ms. Dlouhy said that their living arrangement has made her reluctant to take a leadership position at their evangelical church. ""I know that I don't live right based on what I believe in,"" she said.
To show their commitment, she and Mr. Pulliam exchanged wedding bands. Hers is inscribed ""His Queen."" His ring says, ""Her King.""
Even among middle-class couples on relatively secure financial footing, some don't feel an urgency to marry.
Laura Supica, 39, said she met ""the man I will definitely grow old with"" when she served Chris Peary a drink seven years ago while working as a bartender in Bangor, Maine. They got a dog and a cat, bought a second house—a fixer-upper Mr. Peary is renovating and helped pay for—and made plans for a life together.

Ms. Supica now works as an administrative assistant in state government, and Mr. Peary, 39, is a proofreader and printing technician at the University of Maine. Together, they bring home about $83,000 a year and don't expect to marry. ""I feel like my needs are met,"" Ms. Supica said.
The couple said the main drawback of their arrangement is that Mr. Peary has few if any legal rights to the two houses that are in Ms. Supica's name. ""I certainly have concerns about what would happen if we break up,"" he said.
Mr. Schneider, the UC Berkeley sociologist, found that men and women in jobs with standard schedules and fringe benefits were more likely to marry. Differences in job quality accounted for as much as a quarter of the greater propensity to marry among people with at least a bachelor's degree compared with those with less than a high school diploma, according to a 2019 paper by Mr. Schneider and two co-authors.
Finding stable jobs helped pave the way to marriage for Tilah Larson and Jeff W. Mohrmann. They became a couple while enrolled at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland and graduated a year apart during the recession.
Unable to find professional jobs, they each moved back in with their parents—hers in Wisconsin, his in Colorado. Ms. Larson worked at a high-end retailer, and Mr. Mohrmann worked as a repairman on a railroad track.
After Mr. Mohrmann landed a job at a law firm in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 2009, Ms. Larson moved there and found work as an analyst for the city parks department. ""It kind of felt like we had found our places, our careers,"" Ms. Larson, 39, said. They married in 2014 and now earn a combined income of about $210,000 a year.

Colorado Springs has one of the highest rates of marriage among college-educated adults of any metropolitan area in the U.S.—about 72% of people ages 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or more, the Journal found.
Matrimony spurred the couple to set long-term financial goals, including paying off their six-figure student debt, saving for retirement and acquiring income-generating rental property.
Last year, they bought a four-bedroom duplex. They plan to rent the second unit on Airbnb and expect to get as much as $200 a night. In the next five years they want to buy a house in New Orleans to rent, as well as use for vacations.
Mr. Mohrmann, 38, said that having the stability of Ms. Larson's paycheck made it easier for him to start his own law practice and then become a financial adviser.
He said his wife's financial habits have rubbed off. ""If I would have married a less frugal woman,"" he said, ""I would have been broke by now.""

The Alabama Department of Public Health said child care facilities will be allowed to open but must keep the number of children in any room or other enclosed space below 12. The change followed an order Thursday that prohibited gatherings of 25 people or more and mandated closing child day care centers, preschools, schools and senior citizen centers. Dining in restaurants and bars also was prohibited, with only takeout ordering allowed. Health officials said the goal of slowing disease transmission is to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday clarified that limits on public gatherings did not apply to work and workplace events.  Alaska Anchorage: The mayor has announced his third emergency order in response to the coronavirus pandemic as more cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in the state and the city’s supply of swabs needed to test for the disease runs low. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz issued the “hunker down” order Friday, telling residents to stay at home as much as possible, KTVA-TV reports. The order is effective from Sunday evening until March 31. On Saturday, the mayors of Ketchikan, Saxman and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough in southeast Alaska issued a joint proclamation telling residents to stay at home as much as possible. As in Anchorage, grocery stores and other essential businesses will remain open. As of Saturday night, the state has 15 cases of people with the coronavirus, according to the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. “I’m asking people to do the right thing,” Berkowitz said at a news conference Friday.  Arizona Phoenix: A second person stricken with the coronavirus has died in the state, which now has 152 confirmed cases, authorities said Sunday. The Arizona Department of Health Services and Maricopa County Department of Public Health said the latest man who died was in his 70s and had underlying health conditions. The state’s first reported death from COVID-19 was announced Friday. Authorities said that man was a city of Phoenix employee in his 50s who also had underlying health conditions. “As testing increases, we expect the number of positive cases to continue rising,” Gov. Doug Ducey said in a Twitter post Sunday. “It’s important that everyone takes this seriously. ” Ducey announced a series of executive orders Thursday including shutting down bars and dine-in options in counties with confirmed cases, designed to slow the spread of the virus.  Arkansas Little Rock: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state rose by nearly 50, including more than 40 residents and staff of nursing homes, officials said Sunday. The state Department of Health reported that 165 people have tested positive for the illness caused by the coronavirus, up from 118 on Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said at a news conference that this was the largest daily increase in diagnosed cases in the state and comes as testing is ramping up. The vast majority of people who contract the virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but it can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. Dr. Nathaniel Smith, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, said 19 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19, and six have been on a ventilator at various points.  California Oakland: Most Californians stayed at home on a Saturday unlike any its 40 million residents had ever seen before. Less than 48 hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an unprecedented stay-at-home order to help curb the coronavirus spread, shopping centers and streets were empty. Churches were closed. Playgrounds deserted. However, stores and farmer markets were bustling, and many people took advantage of the beautiful spring weather and rushed to the outdoors. At beaches and parks, not everyone heeded calls to practice social distancing, prompting Newsom to call them out. “Those young people are still out there on the beaches thinking it’s time to party. It’s time to grow up, time to wake up,” he said at an evening news conference. “Time to recognize that it’s not just about the old folks; it’s about your impact on their lives. Don’t be selfish. ” Colorado Denver: Hotels, motels and vacation rentals at the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park are closing to help stem the spread of the coronavirus as the tourism-dependent community discourages people from visiting. Under an order taking effect at noon Monday, all short-term lodging will be closed in Estes Park and the surrounding area. The order is set to stay in effect through April 17. Local workers, long-term residents of short-term facilities and people who are quarantined are exempt. The age and health of a significant number of the area’s population is at risk of having serious complications from COVID-19, and the move came at the urging of Estes Park’s hospital, according to an announcement from the town and Larimer County. At least six people have died because of the coronavirus in Colorado.  Connecticut Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont urged residents to sign up for cellphone alerts Sunday, saying he will deliver a recorded message to more than 4 million phone numbers through the state’s CTAlert system about the coronavirus. The message from the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Hartford will urge all residents to stay home and will be accompanied by a text message with a link to Connecticut’s coronavirus website. In Greenwich, First Selectman Fred Camillo ordered all town parks and beaches closed as of 8 p. m. Sunday to keep people from congregating. There were more than 8,000 visitors to one town park Saturday, he said. Meanwhile, a nursing home resident in his 80s is the state’s fifth resident to die from the coronavirus, Lamont said Saturday. So far, 223 people in the state have been diagnosed with the virus, including 43 hospitalized for treatment.  Delaware Wilmington: Public health officials have confirmed 47 coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday morning. A new round of testing will begin Monday at undisclosed locations in all three Delaware counties. As the number of cases continues to rise, state officials have instituted increasingly stringent guidelines and restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Gov. John Carney ordered Delaware beaches to close Saturday in response to packed beaches the day before, which was unseasonably warm. Many beach towns announced their own restrictions, including the closure of the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk, where businesses can now only offer takeout or delivery. “If people don’t listen to the guidance, if they don’t listen to what the governor’s saying, he has to impose additional restrictions,” Carney’s spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, said Saturday.  District of Columbia Washington: D. C. Health Department officials say four members of the district’s Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have now tested positive for coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. Officials said they are in the process of contacting anyone who had contact with the individuals to advise they self-quarantine. “This is a reminder of the heroic work our first responders are carrying out during these unprecedented times,” said Gregory Dean, the department’s chief. Washington, D. C. , is under a state of emergency, with 39 cases of coronavirus reported in the district, prompting schools to close until April 1 and the government to operate on a modified schedule to mitigate the spread of the virus.  Florida St. Petersburg: More than 720 people in Florida have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday as he resisted an official’s call to issue a statewide “stay-at-home” order. The bulk of the coronavirus cases have been in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. There have been more than 11 deaths statewide, he said, including a third death at a Broward County nursing home. More mobile testing sites are coming online, and hundreds more are being tested each day, DeSantis said during a news conference Saturday afternoon in Tallahassee. DeSantis said new testing sites at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando and the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens will open next week. Also Saturday, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told residents to brace for a “stay-at-home order” in coming days. “It will be soon; I would be surprised if it’s not by Monday,” Castor told reporters Saturday. “Time is of the essence. ” Georgia Atlanta: Three additional deaths were attributed to the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total to 23, with 600 confirmed cases reported statewide, according to health officials. While schools and colleges statewide have been closed, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has refrained from ordering restaurants and other businesses to shut down, leaving local governments to decide whether and how to impose restrictions aimed at slowing the outbreak. The 23 people who have died from COVID-19 in Georgia range in age from 42 to 85, and at least 19 of them had underlying conditions, according to Sunday’s Georgia Department of Health update. Dougherty County, where Albany is the county seat, appears to be particularly hard-hit, with four dozen confirmed cases and six deaths. Local officials there ordered residents to stay home unless they’re going to work, buying food, seeking medical care or exercising, and they urged people to report anyone seen violating the shelter-in-place order.  Hawaii Honolulu: The governor has instituted a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine starting Thursday of all people traveling to the state as part of efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus. The order applies to returning residents as well as visitors. It applies to all arrivals at Hawaii airports from the continental U. S. and international destinations and extends to other private and commercial aircraft. Returning residents must quarantine themselves at home, Gov. David Ige’s office said. Visitors must quarantine themselves in their hotel room or rented lodging. People under quarantine may only leave their homes for medical emergencies or to seek medical care, the governor’s office said. They cannot visit public spaces such as pools, fitness centers or restaurants. Failure to follow the order is a misdemeanor and punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both, the governor’s office said.  Idaho Boise: The state House ended its legislative session Friday after balancing fears of spreading the coronavirus with potential vetoes of several bills representatives will now be powerless to override. The House voted 32-28 to end the session a day after the Senate went home. They would have needed to stay five more days to wait out a veto decision by Republican Gov. Brad Little. “Under ordinary circumstance, we’d have stayed and let, and I believe the Senate would have stayed, and let the five days toll,” said Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke. The coronavirus “caused enough concern that has made people wonder about the wisdom of going home and coming back on Monday. ” One bill that could be vetoed bans transgender people from changing the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a federal court ruling a previous Idaho ban was unconstitutional.  Illinois Chicago: Gov. J. B. Pritzker criticized the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Sunday, saying the state hasn’t received enough medical supplies, prompting an angry response from President Donald Trump. Pritzker said Illinois got a recent supply, but it was a fraction of what was requested from the federal government. The first-term Democrat, who has issued a statewide “stay at home order” amid the pandemic, said Illinois is buying supplies from the open market, as are other states also in need of supplies. “We’re all competing against each other,” Pritzker told CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “This should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government. ” Trump, who has said repeatedly that his administration is not to blame for the growing pandemic, lashed out on Twitter, saying governors should not be “blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings. ” Indiana Indianapolis: The state reported two new deaths from the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths statewide to six, public health officials said. Indiana has recorded 201 total cases, including 76 new cases announced Sunday. Of those, the highest number was in Marion County, which reported 35 new cases, followed by Hamilton County, which reported eight cases. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Friday delayed Indiana’s May 5 primary election until June 2. But he said he would need to see more signs of widespread spread of the virus before taking action such as the governors of California, Illinois and New York state in ordering nearly all residents to stay in their homes.  Iowa Des Moines: Health officials have confirmed 23 new cases of COVID-19 to bring the state’s total Saturday to 68 – up more than 50% from the day before. Johnson County reported five new cases, Polk County had four, Linn County had three, and Allamakee and Black Hawk counties each reported two new cases, the Iowa Department of Public Health said in a news release. The counties of Dubuque, Fayette, Henry, Muscatine, Pottawattamie, Story and Washington each had one new case. Those infected included six who are 61 years or older, nine who are 41 to 60 years old, and eight who are 18 to 40. The new numbers came a day after Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a state emergency declaration that includes the temporary suspension of penalties and interest on late property tax payments, prevents some home evictions, and allows bars and restaurants to sell unopened bottles of alcohol for consumption off premises.  Kansas Topeka: Residents will be able to get medicine without an in-person visit to the doctor during the coronavirus crisis under a new executive order that Gov. Laura Kelly announced Sunday. Kelly, a Democrat, announced two new orders aimed at temporarily expanding health care access. She said in a statement that the orders “will make sure Kansas families can access needed care and supplies until we have weathered this storm. ” Fifty-five cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, are now confirmed in Kansas. They include two deaths. One was announced in Johnson County on Saturday. The state’s first death from the virus, a Kansas City-area nursing home resident in Wyandotte County, was reported March 12. Another executive order issued by Kelly eases motor carrier rules and regulations such as weight restrictions. Kelly said the goal is to allow for quicker delivery of resources to address the pandemic.  Kentucky Franklin: Gov. Andy Beshear announced Saturday that a third person has died from the coronavirus as the total number of confirmed cases in the state increased to nearly 90. Beshear said the 67-year-old Anderson County man who died had several other health problems. “None of us have liked that this has happened, but we need to think about his family and provide all the support to him that we can,” he said. The Democratic governor also urged residents to continue social distancing in order to prevent COVID-19 cases as much as possible. He said members of the public should pursue assistance if they need as the virus continues to spread across the state, urging that there “is no stigma” to doing so. “Be that good neighbor,” Beshear said. “Every time there is a group where large groups are not absolutely necessary, we allow this coronavirus to spread. ” Louisiana Baton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has issued a statewide “stay at home” directive, ordering all 4. 6 million people in Louisiana to stay at home starting at 5 p. m. Monday unless they’re performing an essential task like getting food or medicine. Workers in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ offices and other critical infrastructure are exempt from the governor’s directive. “The bottom line is we are in a race against time when it comes to this coronavirus and its rapid spread in Louisiana,” Edwards said Sunday. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell had issued a similar order for that city two days ago. As of Sunday, coronavirus infections in Louisiana have climbed to more than 830. Twenty people in the state have died of COVID-19, state health officials said. Edwards warned that the state was on a similar trajectory in cases to Italy, the virus has overwhelmed hospitals, and Louisiana’s health system could soon be overloaded with patients.  Maine Augusta: Concerns about social distancing pushed the state to postpone the start of its season for commercial baby eel fishing by at least two weeks, officials said. The season for baby eels, called elvers, was scheduled to begin Sunday. It’s one of the most lucrative fisheries in the state. The baby eels are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies and can fetch more than $2,000 per pound at the docks. But Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher said Friday that the nature of the elver fishery makes it “impossible to follow social distancing recommendations,” such as maintaining 6 feet of distance from other people as part of an effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the state jumped by more than a dozen from Friday to Saturday to 70.  Maryland Ocean City: The mayor of the state’s most popular beach destination wants vacationers to postpone their trips as the state attempts to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. “We’re not encouraging people to come,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan told WBAL-TV on Saturday. “We don’t want them to be here and contract anything while they were down here in Ocean City, even if that’s possible. ” Gov. Larry Hogan has reduced the permissible number of people statewide at gatherings from 50 to 10. He said this week that some people were still holding parties and cookouts and large gatherings, in violation of state law. Meehan said Ocean City will be enforcing all of Hogan’s initiatives: “We’re hoping people will wait for those good times to come back before they travel to the beach. ” Maryland health officials reported 190 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Saturday, about 40 more than was reported Friday. Two people have died.  Massachusetts Boston: The state reported its second virus-related death Saturday night as it prepared to open hundreds of day care sites for the children of medical professionals, emergency workers and others who are expected to keep working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second person in Massachusetts to died from a coronavirus-related illness was a Middlesex County woman in her 50s who had a preexisting condition, a release from the state health department said. On Friday, a Suffolk County man in his 80s was announced as the first person in the state to die from related illness. Gov. Charlie Baker announced Saturday that more than 300 sites will open Monday, with more to follow later. The rest of the state’s child care facilities have been ordered to shut down to help prevent spread of the coronavirus. More than 520 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Massachusetts.  Michigan Detroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that the state needs the federal government to provide not only more test kits and masks but also clear guidance on how best to fight the spread of the coronavirus. “We’re all building the airplane as we fly it right now. We’re doing the best that we can. We’re going to continue to be aggressive, and we’re continually monitoring what the next move we can make is,” she said on ABC’s “This Week. ” “Frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is – we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy. ” She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House but said a point will come in which failures will need to be examined. Michigan has reported 787 cases in total of COVID-19. Eight people have died.  Minnesota St. Paul: The state’s number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus rose to 169 on Sunday, up 32 from a day earlier. The state has had one death, a Ramsey County resident in their 80s who died Thursday. That person came in contact with an infected family member who had a history of international travel, said Kris Ehresmann, the Minnesota Department of Health’s infectious disease director. The person also had underlying medical conditions, she said. Sunday’s update noted that the virus had been confirmed in two new counties, Cass and LeSueur. Ehresmann told reporters during a conference call Sunday afternoon that 17 patients have been hospitalized so far. Ten remain hospitalized, including five in intensive care. The other seven are recovering at home. The 169 infected patients’ ages range from 10 to 94, Ehresmann said. Thirty-four health care workers have been infected, she added.  Mississippi Jackson: Confirmed coronavirus infections climbed to more than 200 in Mississippi, and the governor announced plans to provide quicker access to unemployment benefits for residents affected by the outbreak. The more than 200 cases were reported as of 6 p. m. Saturday, according to state health department figures updated Sunday. A single COVID-19 death has been reported in the state. Gov. Tate Reeves on Saturday took action to help relieve burdens on the state’s workforce, according to a news release. He signed an executive order instructing the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to expedite payments to unemployed workers and relax collection requirements on employers. The governor also suspended collection activity, including enrollment of liens and tax garnishments.  Missouri O’Fallon: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to 90 Sunday, including at least five cases tied to one suburban St. Louis preschool. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is up from 75 on Saturday, according to the state health department. Three people have died in Missouri, one each in Boone, Jackson and St. Louis counties. At least five cases are tied to Temple Israel’s preschool in Creve Coeur. St. Louis and St. Louis County authorities on Saturday announced mandatory stay-at-home orders, effective Monday. Kansas City officials followed later Saturday with a similar order. The order in Kansas City and surrounding areas is set to begin Tuesday.  Montana Helena: There were 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday afternoon, up from 27 the day before and adding three cases from Cascade County into the mix. Gallatin County now has the most cases, with 10 confirmed incidents of the respiratory illness that is now a pandemic. The virus has surfaced in 11 of Montana’s 56 counties. So far there have been 10 cases confirmed in Gallatin County, six cases in Yellowstone County, four in Missoula County, three in Cascade and Lewis and Clark counties, two in Flathead and Silver Bow counties, and one each in Broadwater, Madison, Ravalli and Roosevelt counties. Health officials warned Sunday that there is evidence the coronavirus has been spreading in Gallatin County, stressing the need for the public to take precautions to prevent more people from being exposed to it.  Nebraska Omaha: Health officials have confirmed 10 new cases of coronavirus to give the state a total of 49 cases. Douglas County health officials reported eight new cases Saturday. Five of the cases are related to travel, and three of the cases had contact with a previous positive case in the area. Health officials in Lancaster and Buffalo counties also announced the second cases in both those counties. Both of those new cases are family members of the first case in each county. Health officials said a 48-year-old Lancaster County man who tested positive for COVID-19 visited Charleston’s Restaurant and Freezing Moo in Omaha on March 15 before he was diagnosed with the illness. Anyone who was at those businesses that afternoon should monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and cough, for 14 days.  Nevada Las Vegas: While the governor joined other U. S. officials invoking extraordinary measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the mayor of Las Vegas is pushing back against a shutdown of the casinos that power the city and the state economy. Governors in California, New York and Illinois have ordered millions of people to stay in their homes except for essentials and exercise, while Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other leaders around the country have told restaurants and other businesses to shut down. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman became an outspoken outlier by declaring that her city should be allowed to stay open for business. Nevada has tallied two deaths and more than 190 cases of COVID-19, almost all in the Las Vegas area. “Our economy depends on tourism and being open for dining, entertainment, gaming, sports,” Goodman said in a prepared speech before the Las Vegas City Council.  New Hampshire Concord: Retail stores are being ordered to temporarily transition to the use of single-use paper or plastic bags because of the risk that reusable bags could aid in transmission of the coronavirus. In the order issued late Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu directed all grocers and retail stores in New Hampshire to transition to use only new paper or plastic grocery bags provided by stores “as soon as feasibly possible. ” “Our grocery store workers are on the front lines of COVID-19, working around the clock to keep New Hampshire families fed,” the governor said in a statement. “With identified community transmission, it is important that shoppers keep their reusable bags at home given the potential risk to baggers, grocers and customers. ” New Jersey Paramus: Authorities say a drive-thru coronavirus testing center once again reached capacity Sunday morning shortly after opening, but the site will reopen Monday – and a second drive-thru center is also expected to open in Monmouth County. Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco said on his Facebook page that the site at Bergen Community College would reopen at 8 a. m. Monday. He said the county has the most cases in the state and has recorded five deaths, so “it is important that we test as many symptomatic residents as possible. ” The mass testing center was at capacity minutes after opening Saturday for its second day of operations. Hundreds of cars were waiting in lines, but less than 15 minutes after opening, police began turning people away. Tedesco urged people coming to the site, who must be New Jersey residents, to be patient. They will be screened for symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing.  New Mexico Albuquerque: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has grown to 57, and two local high schools’ students and staff are being advised to self-isolate because a student at one has tested positive for the disease. The 14 new cases include a baby boy and eight other people in Bernalillo County, which includes metro Albuquerque, and one each in Dona Ana, Lea, Sandoval, Santa Fe and Taos counties, according to the state Department of Health. Albuquerque Public Schools officials said the Department of Health notified them Friday that it was investigating a case involving a Del Norte High School student. The school’s students and staff and those of Nex+Gen Academy Magnet School also located on the Del Norte campus were advised to self-isolate “in an abundance of caution” and to contact the state if symptoms surfaced and required medical attention.  New York New York: The governor said Sunday that he was exasperated that people are still ignoring his social distancing orders, saying he spent part of the previous day watching people clustering in groups and acting like it was just another nice spring day. “There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate. You would think there is nothing going on. In parts of New York City, it was just a bright, sunny Saturday,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. He said city officials must come up with a plan immediately to prevent people from congregating in parks or elsewhere, saying it was a matter of life and death. Nearly 2,000 people have been hospitalized in the state with the virus, and 114 have died, Cuomo said. More than 15,000 have tested positive statewide, including 9,000 in New York City. “I don’t know what they’re not understanding,” Cuomo said, his voice rising. “This is not life as usual. ” North Carolina Duck: People renting beach houses in counties that have blocked visitor access to the Outer Banks because of the new coronavirus should get their money refunded, a state panel says. The North Carolina Real Estate Commission ruled Thursday that state law sides with tenants in this situation, reports The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Virginia. Dare and Currituck counties have approved orders preventing visitors and non-resident property owners from entering the Outer Banks. And Hyde County has blocked visitor access to Ocracoke Island. Landlords who won’t refund money are open to a lawsuit, according to the commission. Monica Thibodeau, the owner of Carolina Designs Realty in Duck, said social media and phone calls have been mixed about the visitor prohibitions. The company manages vacation rentals for owners for a fee. “We’re trying to keep everybody happy as possible,” said Thibodeau, a member of Duck’s town council.  North Dakota Bismarck: Health officials say the state appears to be holding its own as the coronavirus crisis stretches on. The state Department of Health reported Sunday morning that labs tested 106 additional people for the virus between 3 p. m. Saturday and 9 a. m. Sunday, and all tests came back negative. That means the state is holding at 28 positives, three hospitalizations and no deaths. Meanwhile, two hospital executives said Saturday that while their workforce is keeping up with the number of the coronavirus cases, they’re asking former doctors and nurses to think about returning if the numbers continue to climb. Dr. Michael LeBeau of Sanford Health and Kurt Schley of CHI-St. Alexius Health said an order by Gov. Doug Burgum that eases licensing requirements will allow them to bring in people from other states, most of whom are already in their systems. They also put out a plea to local retirees.  Ohio Columbus: The Ohio Board of Pharmacy took an emergency 7-0 vote Sunday by telephone on a new regulation designed to prevent hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug – chloroquine – that are sold around the world under a variety of brand and generic names. They are malaria drugs that are seeing a surge in nationwide demand after President Donald Trump suggested they could treat people with the coronavirus, even though the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said science does not support that idea. Under the new regulation, pharmacists cannot dispense chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or sell them for a COVID-19 diagnosis unless it fulfills various prescribing requirements, including a positive test result, and is limited to a 14-day supply. They are prohibited from selling the drugs for prophylactic use for the coronavirus.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: A second person in the state has died of COVID-19 as the number of Oklahomans with the illness caused by the novel coronavirus increased by more than a dozen, health officials said Sunday. The man who died was in his 50s and lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said in a statement. It did not provide further details on the circumstances of his illness and death. The number of people in the state who have tested positive for the virus increased to 67 Sunday, from 53 the day before. The health department said 11 of those people are hospitalized. Oklahoma County has the most cases, with 26, following by Cleveland County, with 13, and Tulsa County, with six.  Oregon Portland: The state is reporting another death from COVID-19, bringing the total to four, as mayors and others urged Gov. Kate Brown to issue more restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. And a city on Oregon’s northwest coast, Warrenton, declared a state of emergency, banned camping and ordered campgrounds to close. The city also prohibited short-term rentals and home-stay lodging and told hotels to close after an influx of weekend visitors, who were told to leave within 24 hours. The Oregon Health Authority said the latest death was a 72-year-old woman in Marion County who had underlying health conditions. She tested positive March 15 and died Friday at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center. The state also reported 23 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing the total to 137.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: Health officials on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases of coronavirus in the state, for a total of more than 470. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Saturday that people with mild symptoms do not necessarily need to get tested, and, after calling their doctor, they may be able to stay home, rest, and take fluids and anti-fever medication. Testing is being prioritized for symptomatic people who are health care providers, elderly, very ill or dealing with chronic medical conditions, Levine said. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania House State Government Committee Chairman Garth Everett, R-Lycoming, said Sunday that legislation is being drafted to delay the state’s primary from April 28 to June 2. Everett said he hopes to get the legislation out of his committee Monday and through the Republican-controlled chamber this coming week, to send it to the Senate.  Rhode Island Providence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has ordered all gyms, salons and other “close contact” businesses to close by Monday afternoon as the state works to prevent spread of the coronavirus. The Democratic governor announced the new measures Sunday, saying the state needs to be “more aggressive” in its response to the virus. Her new order also requires theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues to close their in-person operations, and Raimondo is urging all residents to work from home if possible. The order requires gyms, fitness centers, hair salons, nail salons, spas and tattoo parlors to close by 5 p. m. Monday. Raimondo said it was a tough decision but vowed to help small businesses get back on their feet later. Any businesses that remain open will be required to keep 6 feet between customers, regularly clean surfaces and ensure proper hygiene among employees.  South Carolina Columbia: The state’s largest public university said Saturday that 18 students living in a campus dormitory are being held in quarantine after one of them tested positive for the coronavirus. The University of South Carolina students were being kept in isolation “pending further investigation” to reduce risks of spreading the new virus, the school said in a news release. It said administrators learned late Friday that a student in a residence hall on the Columbia campus was confirmed to have been infected. Campus staff are making sure the quarantined students have food and any needed medical attention, according to the university. It said at least 11 other students and one faculty member have also tested positive for the coronavirus, but all were either off campus or in other states. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 across South Carolina exceeded 170 on Saturday, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. There were three deaths statewide linked to the virus.  South Dakota Pierre: The number of people testing positive for the coronavirus increased from 14 to 21, state health officials said Sunday, but Gov. Kristi Noem declined to order businesses to close as her counterparts have in some other areas of the country. Noem and South Dakota Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon told reporters the new victims apparently contracted the virus through travel or by interacting with another person who had it. However, Noem warned that Beadle County appears to be on the verge of community spread, a term that describes when the source is unknown. She urged local leaders in that county to impose social distancing measures, including limiting group sizes, but stopped short of issuing any executive orders. The Rapid City Journal reports Pennington County commissioners complained during a special Saturday meeting that coronavirus shutdowns elsewhere are going too far.  Tennessee Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Sunday urged residents to work from home and ordered bars and restaurants to close for 14 days starting Monday with the exception of drive-thru, takeout and delivery services in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Lee’s sweeping order closed gyms and fitness centers from Monday until April 6. He also barred most visitors to nursing homes, retirement homes and long-term care facilities and prohibited social gatherings of 10 or more people. Residents were told to work from home “where feasible,” but Lee stopped short of mandating that people shelter in place. The order on bars and restaurants allows for the sale of unopened alcoholic beverages, including beer, for takeout or delivery orders as long as they are accompanied by food. In Nashville, Mayor John Cooper on Sunday ordered all nonessential businesses to close for 14 days starting Monday. The number of confirmed cases in Tennessee has risen to more than 370, with one death.  Texas Austin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday said the National Guard could begin monitoring drive-in testing sites Monday, and the Republican declined at a news conference to follow the lead of other states with a statewide “shelter in place” order. But Abbott warned Texans that it could be coming if they don’t heed his previous orders Friday that limited social gatherings to under 10 people; closed schools, bars and gyms; and banned dine-in eating at restaurants. “Stricter standards will be taken,” if necessary, Abbott said. “If you don’t have an essential reason for leaving your home, you should not be leaving your home. ” The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 334 people statewide have tested positive for the virus, up from 304 on Saturday, and officials in Dallas said a man in his 80s has become the sixth Texas resident with the disease to die.  Utah Salt Lake City: The state reported its first death related to COVID-19 on Sunday – a man over the age of 60 who had underlying health problems. The unidentified man from Davis County had been at Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful, near Salt Lake City, for two days before his death, the Utah Department of Health hospital operator Mountainstar HCA said in a joint announcement. The man tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, and health officials are working to identify and contact anyone who may have been in close contact with him. Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert said he and his wife extended their deepest sympathies to the man’s family and friends. “The pain this family must be feeling right now puts into perspective the sacrifices we are all making to keep one another safe and healthy. We encourage everyone to do their part by practicing safe health practices, including social distancing,” Herbert said.  Vermont Montpelier: The Vermont Health Department is urging the state’s long-term care facilities to take the temperature of all staff members before they enter the buildings where they work. Workers who show any signs of being ill are being told to stay home. The moves are part of the state’s effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus in long-term care facilities. More than 10 cases of COVID-19 were reported at the Burlington Health and Rehabilitation Center. One patient there died of COVID-19. “This is perhaps the most complex public health event most Vermonters have experienced,” Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said in a statement. “And I can’t repeat this enough – it is extremely important for all of us, young and old, to take extra care to help protect the people most vulnerable to serious illness. ” On Saturday, the health department reported the number of cases of COVID-19 in Vermont jumped more than 50%, going from under 30 to almost 50. Two have died.  Virginia Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam on Sunday offered a sobering timeline of efforts to diminish the intensity of the coronavirus outbreak, warning that life as we’ve known it will be disrupted “for a long time. ” Health officials said the state’s load of positive COVID-19 cases had grown by 65 from the day before to nearly 220 as of Sunday, with three deaths, including a Fairfax County resident who died Saturday. The increase in cases is attributed in part to the increased testing capacity in the state, Northam said at a news conference, but it’s also because the virus continues to spread. “COVID-19 is going to be with us for a long time – months, not weeks. We need to begin adjusting to that reality,” he said. “It is difficult to live with uncertainty. But the sooner we all adopt these new ways of living, the sooner we will all get through this. ” Northam said some people still aren’t heeding the strong advice to avoid nonessential gatherings of more than 10 people. “This is not a holiday; this is not a vacation,” he said.  Washington Seattle: A second patient at Washington state’s largest psychiatric hospital has tested positive for the new coronavirus. The Western State Hospital patient was on a different ward from the one who tested positive last week, officials with the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a release Saturday. Both patients were being treated at a Pierce County hospital. Washington state leads the nation in coronavirus deaths with at least 94 fatalities and almost 1,800 positive cases. Officials also reported last week that a hospital employee had the disease and was recovering at home. After those reports, union hospital workers sent a letter to officials demanding that all employees who had contact with the sick patients and worker be tested for COVID-19. But state officials are asking workers to “self-screen” for symptoms instead and to stay home if they have symptoms.  West Virginia Charleston: Gov. Jim Justice has a message about the coronavirus pandemic: It’s like a scary movie. In an apparent attempt to soothe a nervous public, Justice offered a rambling response to the virus in a statewide address Saturday night in which he declined to order a broad lockdown, issued dire warnings about New York state, urged people to follow existing protocols and admitted that perhaps his speech could have waited until Monday. “It’s like we’re all lost in a movie that we can’t relate to in any way,” he said during the roughly 25-minute address that left many on social media scratching their heads. He asked people to search their souls to ask if they believed it’s possible for thousands of West Virginians to die. He fell back on platitudes. He stumbled through math equations. “If we don’t act, and we don’t act as strongly as possible right now, we’re going to lose lives and lots of lives,” the Republican governor said.  Wisconsin Madison: Gov. Tony Evers has asked federal officials for help in obtaining tens of thousands of additional pieces of protective equipment as the state continues to grapple with the coronavirus. Evers announced Saturday that he has directed state emergency management officials to ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help in obtaining gear for first responders, including 50,000 masks; 10,000 face shields, 11,000 coveralls, 35,000 pairs of gloves and 3,000 N95 masks, which are designed to ensure a very close facial fit. The state is also trying to obtain more equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile. So far the state has received about 52,000 N95 masks, 130,000 surgical masks, 25,000 face shields, 20,000 surgical gowns, 100 coveralls and 36,000 pairs of gloves from the stockpile. Those supplies are being distributed to health care providers in areas with community spread.  Wyoming Casper: A shortage of testing capacity is making it harder for health officials in the state to determine just how many people have been infected with coronavirus, doctors said, while Gov. Mark Gordon sought to expedite delivery of supplies related to the virus. The nationwide testing shortage includes not enough equipment to reliably move swabs from clinics to labs, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Meanwhile, state guidelines limit testing to high-risk cases: the elderly, health care workers and those in contact with people who’ve been infected. People with milder cases, who make up over 80% of those with the COVID-19 illness, largely are not being tested. “Most providers feel like this is the time we should be testing; this is the time we should figure out where the clusters are,” Wyoming Medical Center chief of staff Dr. Andy Dunn said. “However, due to the scarcity of the supplies, it is what it is. ” From USA TODAY Network and wire reports This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Distancing failures, equipment roadblocks, testing limits: News from around our 50 statesWord count: 7451Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

NEW YORK - Marisa Hunter believes she may have contracted coronavirus earlier this month, when severe fatigue and gastrointestinal issues left her feeling weak.
She tried to get a test for the virus but was not able to get one, and by the time she spoke to a doctor, her symptoms were resolving.
Initially, the 31-year-old social media manager and model left her apartment in Long Beach, N.Y., where her lease had just expired, and went to her mother's house in Connecticut to try to recuperate. Then over the weekend, she flew from Connecticut to Bonita Springs, Fla., to live with her fiance, who had already moved.
Hunter's three-week journey is an example of the behaviors and travel habits now at the center of a deepening split among public officials and health experts over how best to contain the spread of the coronavirus as sick New Yorkers begin inundating hospitals while others try to flee.
On Tuesday, amid concern that New York residents and visitors were exporting the virus to other cities, President Trump's coronavirus response team instructed anyone who has been in New York recently to self-quarantine for at least 14 days if they left the city, even for the suburbs. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has gone even further, signing an executive order mandating visitors and residents of his state to self-quarantine if they have recently been to New York. 
The actions have touched off debate about whether it is practical for the Trump administration or individual states to issue guidance that seeks to restrict the movement of Americans, based on where they have recently visited domestically. 
The debate is expected to intensify in coming weeks as the number of coronavirus cases in some cities is predicted to grow dramatically while other regions of the country could largely escape the pandemic, according to public health officials. 
""These are exigent circumstances, so you got to be able to exercise good judgment in a situation like this,"" said Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), a former Florida governor and attorney general who said he supported DeSantis's order. ""I think he is doing exactly what is right to protect the people of Florida and, frankly, our visitors.""
But with the number of confirmed coronavirus cases also spiking in Louisiana, Michigan and Texas, many local officials appear hesitant to embrace isolating residents based solely on their domestic travel history.
""The last thing we want is our states and cities and counties pitting our residents against each other,"" said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties. ""This is a time when the country needs to come together, and not start pointing fingers at each other. … It's a very mobilized society, people move around every day, and we like to remind everyone … this is a national and a global issue, and we want a coordinated federal, state and local response. ""
At a news conference Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) largely sidestepped the White House's suggestion that New Yorkers self-isolate if they leave the city. 
""That is a medical advisory, and the most important thing in life is to know what you don't know, and I don't know medicine,"" Cuomo said. 
But Howard A. Zucker, the New York health commissioner, flatly rejected the guidance, which had been issued by Anthony S. Fauci and Deborah L. Birx, who are advising the White House coronavirus response. Zucker said people who have recently been to New York City but traveled elsewhere should follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about ""social distancing"" but otherwise should not feel compelled to self-quarantine unless they are ill. 
""The CDC guidelines recommend you stay a social distance away whether that is in New York City or not,"" Zucker said. ""These cases are all over the country. It's not just New York.""
Other New York health officials were more guarded in their skepticism, noting that the virus has spread throughout New York City with such speed that they are now telling city residents to assume they have already been exposed. 
Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for disease control at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said his message for New York ""isn't very far off"" from the message being delivered by the White House.
""We have to be honest with ourselves and realize that diseases, infections always come with stigma,"" Daskalakis said. ""And I think a lot of New Yorkers aren't used to that.""
Since moving to Florida, Hunter said she has been mindful that many of her new neighbors are elderly, which makes them susceptible to severe illness if they contract covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. She has been mostly staying home and wears a mask and gloves when she's out. 
""Statistically, I think people who travel out of New York do have a higher chance of carrying it,"" said Hunter. 
Still, she said she doesn't plan to comply with DeSantis's order because she arrived in the state on Saturday, before he issued it.
With an additional 5,100 cases reported Wednesday, New York now represents half of the more than 65,000 cases across the country. With 31,000 cases, it has nearly 10 times as many as the state with the second-highest total, neighboring New Jersey. 
""I have no doubt that the virus was here much earlier than we even knew,"" Cuomo said. ""And I have no doubt the virus was here much earlier than any other state.""
Based on projections from New York health officials and independent analysts, Cuomo said he expects the virus will peak in the state in about three weeks. At that point, he said, New York may need 140,000 hospital beds, more than double current capacity. 
Working with the Trump administration, Cuomo said he hopes to fill much of the shortage by expanding the existing capacity of current hospitals, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers have begun constructing field hospitals. The state also plans to convert college dormitories into hospital rooms, which could produce an additional 29,000 beds. 
Even after all of that, however, Cuomo said New York could still need an additional 20,000 hospital beds to reach 140,000. The state may have to use hotel rooms to meet those needs, he said.
Meanwhile, New York City officials were making plans for additional morgue capacity. Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, said the city has a capacity for up to 900 bodies in the city's morgues across its five boroughs. Although Worthy-Davis said the morgues ""are not right now at or near capacity,"" she said the Office of Emergency Management has set up ""contingency plans"" that include positioning ""tents and trucks"" outside of city hospitals.
""We need to be prepared to have the space,"" Worthy-Davis said.
FEMA said in a statement Wednesday that, in addition to New York state, it has received requests from North Carolina and Hawaii for ""Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams,"" staffed by the Department of Health and Human Services, which assist states and cities with mass casualty events.
To try to head off a surge of fatalities, Cuomo has stressed that the state needs to amass 30,000 ventilators, which help covid-19 patients breathe if their lungs begin to fail. New York has so far amassed just half of that amount, Cuomo said. 
""We need help from the entire country right now,"" said Cuomo, adding that he is pleading with Trump to fast-track ventilators to the state that the governor will then ship to other states when they are needed. 
For Lenore Cheeseman, who lives in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, the shortage of ventilators means she spends her days terrified that her 18-year-old son could contract the virus. 
Her son, Michael, is a quadriplegic who has been confined to the family apartment since his high school was closed. 
He had been going to physical therapy most days before closures started happening, but the program he was participating in also shut down.
""He's dissecting his odds of catching it and his mortality rate,"" said Cheeseman, 52. ""If he gets it, he would absolutely need a ventilator.""
Amid signs that the lockdown of New York is starting affect residents' mental health, state leaders have been trying to boost the availability of mental-health services. Cuomo said 3,100 mental-health counselors have volunteered to respond to those needs.

| Jump to first hitNorth Italy is on lockdown. A quarantine site collapsed. And say no to crowds, long trips and cruise ships.  Vast swaths of northern Italy were essentially locked down in 15 provinces — home to more than a quarter of Italy's 60 million people — Sunday as the coronavirus continues to sweep across the nation at an alarming rate. Italy's death toll rose to 366 on Sunday, and more than 7,300 infections have been confirmed. In Rome, the Vatican announced that it will shut down its museums and the Sistine Chapel until April 3.  In the United States, the death toll climbed to 21 this weekend, with all but three fatalities in Washington state. More than 500 infections have been reported, but the number is rising almost as fast as tests for the virus can be conducted.  President Donald Trump said he is not worried by the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington area, even after it was confirmed that an infected man was at a conference the president attended just outside the capital city.  Immunologist Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, outlined what Americans at home can do to help prevent the spread of coronavirus: ""Say no crowds, no long trips and above all, don't get on a cruise ship. "" The Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California will begin to allow guests to disembark Monday, three days after 21 people aboard tested positive for coronavirus.  Another ship owned by the Princess Cruises line, the Regal Princess, was being held off the coast of Florida Sunday as the ship waits for test results on whether two crew members have contracted the new coronavirus.  In China, a hotel that was being used as a coronavirus quarantine site collapsed with about 80 people trapped inside. At least 10 people died and 23 remain missing as first responders in Beijing sift through the debris.  In other COVID-19 news: ""Scary for everybody"": This is what it's like in Seattle and King County, areas under siege from the coronavirus.

The world celebrates International Women's Day Gender equality is good for the economy – that is the message organizers of International Women's Day 2020 hope to trumpet on Sunday. Gender parity in government, workplaces, health care, sports and media coverage is achievable through collective action, organizers say. They hope this year’s theme, #EachforEqual, will inspire others to challenge biases, question stereotypes and celebrate the achievements of women around the world. Ahead of the day, Duchess Meghan made a surprise stop at a London school in support of gender equity. Meghan's visit commemorated Britain's 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act in 1970, which prohibited workplace discrimination against women.  Google updated its homepage to spotlight women coming together throughout history to fight for gender equality.

| Jump to first hitListen to the music of Heinrich Schütz, a 17th century pathbreaker whose work is largely unknown today.The professor who taught a course I took on Baroque music in graduate school certainly fit the stereotype of a stuffy old musicologist, with his baggy suits and befuddled manner, yet strict adherence to scholarship. But I'll be forever grateful to him, because he essentially introduced me to the music of Heinrich Schütz.I knew of Schütz's historical importance; born in 1585, exactly 100 years before Bach, he is considered the greatest German composer of the 17th century. I hardly knew his music, however, and neither does much of the concert-going public today.One day, that professor put on a recording of Schütz's ""Die Sieben Worte Jesu am Kreuz,"" a setting of Jesus's final words from the cross, framed by two stanzas of a hymn text. From the start of the poignant Introitus to this austerely beautiful piece, I was hooked.Scored for five voices, five unspecified instrumental parts and basso continuo, the music is reverent and wistful. Though there are flowing lines, with voices sometimes in duo, the piece comes across, overall, as declamatory -- like a chorale -- with short passages almost in block chords, and moments that slip into subtly intricate hints of counterpoint. The musical language is steeped in older modal scales, however crucial passages and final phrases settle into diatonic harmony (major and minor chords), the newer language that was emerging in Schütz's time.What grabbed me was the importance Schütz gave to making the German text clear. In faithfully rendering the clipped rhythms and natural cadences of the language, the music taps into the deeper meaning of the words. Schütz drives home the emotions through deliberate repetitions of overlapping phrases. As a devotee of musical theater, I was struck by how Schütz seemed to anticipate the word-setting techniques of Broadway songsmiths.Today, I still know only a fraction of the nearly 500 pieces of Schütz's that survive: motets, madrigals, sacred concertos, oratorios and more. I was looking forward to a program of his music -- including the rarity ""Musikalische Exequien,"" a soft-spoken masterpiece and one of the great requiems -- that the ensemble Tenet Vocal Artists was planning to present on Saturday. But it, like virtually every other concert in New York, was canceled in an effort to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.Still, with concert-going suspended, we should take a chance to listen to music by a towering composer who is overlooked today. And ""Musikalische Exequien"" is the work of someone who would have sympathy for the current global crisis. Based in Dresden, Schütz experienced the numbing disruptions of the Thirty Years' War and lived through a time when Germany was plagued with illnesses: He lost his young wife early on (and never remarried) and watched his two adult daughters die.Schütz's career hinged on a chance encounter. He was born to a prominent bourgeois family of Franconian heritage near the city of Gera, but grew up in Weissenfels, after his father inherited a prosperous inn from his own father.One day, the landgrave Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, who was an amateur composer, stayed at the inn and heard the young Schütz singing -- beautifully. He urged the boy's parents to let him take the 12-year-old to his court, to sing in the choir and study at a collegium he had founded. Schütz's parents, intent on having their son follow a sensible profession, resisted, before giving in.After thriving in his musical studies, Schütz, bowing to family pressure, began to study law in Marburg. But during a visit, the landgrave urged Schütz to go to Venice and work with Giovanni Gabrieli, the famed composer and organist at St. Mark's Basilica. With a stipend from the landgrave, Schütz spent three years there absorbing Italian musical styles and traditions, and would later return to work with Monteverdi. Eventually, Schütz was poached from the landgrave's service and brought to the court in Dresden, where, despite the tumultuous times, he thrived as his fame and influence grew.Schütz's development can be seen as a lifelong attempt to reconcile the Italian style -- steeped in lyricism, multipart madrigals and grand concerted forces with antiphonal choruses and ensembles -- and the German one, which favored leaner sound and contrapuntal textures.Nursing my disappointment over the Tenet concert cancellation, I've been on a binge of Schütz recordings. The influence of Italian style runs through the ""Psalmen Davids,"" settings of some two dozen psalms for small chorus and instruments, including brass. Scholars have described these early works as almost a résumé of Schütz's achievements to date. Though their overall character is reverent and restrained, the antiphonal back-and-forth between small choirs of voices and various batteries of instruments seems unabashedly Venetian.I love the setting of Psalm 150, which calls to praise God with dancing and the sounds of trumpets, harps and cymbals. Stravinsky set the same text as the final movement of ""Symphony of Psalms""; Schütz's version seems just as fresh and startling.In 1990, the conductor Craig Smith and the chorus of Emmanuel Music in Boston recorded a superb album of 21 Schütz motets. The roster of singers in the chorus included names of artists who were already having significant careers, including Jayne West, Mary Westbrook-Geha, Frank Kelley and the irreplaceable Lorraine Hunt (before her marriage to Peter Lieberson). It said much about the respect these singers had for Schütz that they so readily joined a chorus for ravishing, refined masterpieces like ""Sicut Moses Serpentem in deserto Excalvit"" and ""Unser Wandel ist im Himmel.""If Schütz isn't a go-to name for the canon of Western classical music, it's probably because he was squeezed out somewhat by his slightly earlier Italian contemporary Monteverdi. He has also been overshadowed by Bach, his German successor. Scholars say it's difficult to specify how much Schütz's work influenced Bach, but he undeniably forged paths that subsequent German composers followed.Later in life, Schütz -- who died in 1672, at 87 years old -- composed three passions that anticipated those of Bach. These works are affectingly austere. The elegant, supple, quasi-melodious recitatives for the Evangelist and Jesus are unaccompanied; the lucid choral writing is dramatic, but understated. The tenor Peter Schreier, who died last year, recorded all three of the Evangelist roles with the Dresdner Kreuzchor choir, singing with radiant sound and aching sensitivity. I especially love the ""St. Matthew Passion.""I don't think Bach would mind if, now and then, a performance of his own ""St. Matthew Passion"" were replaced with Schütz's. I'd be there.PhotographMuch of the concert-going public doesn't know the music of Heinrich Schütz (1585-1672), left. The Sebastians in 2019 with Tenet Vocal Artists, whose program of Schütz's music was canceled because of the coronavirus.

| Jump to first hitSAN JOSE, Calif. -- When the first case of the coronavirus in Silicon Valley was discovered in late January, health officials were faced with a barrage of questions: What city did the patient live in? Whom had he come in contact with? Which health clinic had he visited before he knew he was infected?Dr. Sara Cody, the chief health officer for Santa Clara County, which has a population of two million across 15 cities, declined to give details.""I can't give the city,"" she said, adding ""we are not going to be giving out information about where he sought health care.""As the coronavirus spreads across the United States the limited disclosure of data by officials would seem to be a footnote to the suffering and economic disruptions that the disease is causing.But medical experts say that how much the public should know has become a critical question that will help determine how the United States confronts this outbreak and future ones.Residents are clamoring to see whether the virus has been detected in their neighborhoods so they can take more steps to avoid any contact. American researchers are starved for data, unlike their colleagues in other countries who are harnessing rivers of information from their more centralized medical systems. And local politicians complain that they cannot provide basic information on the spread of the virus to their constituents.In the perennial tug-of-war between privacy and transparency in the United States, privacy appears to be winning in the coronavirus pandemic.The bare-minimum approach to public disclosures in places like the San Francisco Bay Area is common across the United States. Armed with emergency powers in many areas, public health officers have vast discretion over what information they want, and do not want, to release to the public. Coronavirus cases in California are often listed by county, generally with very little additional information -- such as gender, city of residence or age -- provided.Critics of the threadbare public reporting say it is striking that even in Silicon Valley, which is home to leading technology companies that thrive off the collection of data, residents are given very little information about the movement and dynamics of the virus.California, which has more than 4,600 cases, is a microcosm for how inconsistent the distribution of information has been during the pandemic. Los Angeles County provides a rough age distribution of patients and breaks down the cases into more than 140 cities and communities. On Friday, for example, the county reported 21 cases in Beverly Hills, 28 in the city of Santa Monica and 49 in the neighborhood of Melrose.Across the United States there is even less consistency. New York is listing cases by age bracket, gender and borough despite calls for more localized reporting. Connecticut lists data by town. Florida provides its residents with a wealth of data on the pandemic. The state's Department of Health has a detailed dashboard and reports showing the spread of the virus -- rich with data on the cities affected, the number of people tested, the age brackets of patients, whether they are Florida residents, and the number of cases in nursing homes.Health departments in the Bay Area make the case that releasing more granular data could heighten discrimination against certain communities where there might be clusters. The first cases in the Bay Area were among ethnic Chinese residents returning from trips to China.""Pandemics increase paranoia and stigma,"" said Dr. Rohan Radhakrishna, the deputy health officer of Contra Costa County, across the Bay from San Francisco, which provides only the total number of cases in the county on its website. ""We must be extra cautious in protecting individuals and the community.""In Santa Clara, health officials say they cannot disclose how many cases are found in each city because of the nation's strict medical privacy law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996.But that law was designed for the protection of personal data at doctors' offices and in hospitals and includes provisions for the release of otherwise protected information during emergencies.Using the law as a justification for limiting the release of aggregate data about the coronavirus is ""ridiculous,"" according to Arthur L. Caplan, a professor of bioethics at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine in New York City.Prof. Caplan is among many experts who say the coronavirus is likely to spur a reassessment of medical privacy laws. Already, the Trump Administration waived some provisions of the law this month.""HIPAA was written for a time when there were paper charts,"" Prof. Caplan said. The coronavirus, he said, ""will cause us to rethink a lot of things.""""We will also have to plan for better data exchange and testing,"" he said.The U.S. approach contrasts sharply with that of Singapore and Taiwan, whose fights against the virus have been praised as among the most effective. Both governments make public the suspected linkages of cases, anonymized by numbers. In Singapore the authorities sometimes list neighborhoods where patients lived, their workplaces and churches or mosques that they attended.I. Glenn Cohen, an expert in bioethics at Harvard Law School, says the guiding principle during this crisis should be sharing more rather than less.""Public health depends a lot on public trust,"" he said. ""If the public feels as though they are being misled or misinformed their willingness to make sacrifices -- in this case social distancing -- is reduced.""""That's a strong argument for sharing as much information as you can,"" he said.Experts also point out that it was the government's suppression of information about the virus in China that allowed it to spread quickly before measures were taken to stem it.On Friday the health authorities in Santa Clara, which has more than 590 cases and is home to the headquarters of companies like Google and Apple, added a dashboard that charts the number of daily cases and other metrics.But the county's public information office says it will not publicly disclose the number of cases in each city because doing so could make individuals more easily identifiable.In a sign of how contested the question of public disclosure is, disagreement exists even within the Santa Clara County government.Dr. Jeffrey V. Smith, the county executive, who is both a medical doctor and a lawyer, argues that more precise geographical information about the spread does not help combat the virus because it is already widespread.""Reporting positive tests with a census tract or a city name provides data that is not helpful,"" Dr. Smith said. ""In fact, such data has the risk of stigmatizing areas and regions of the country in a way that does not help.""But David Cortese, a member of the county's board of supervisors, says that the public has the right to know more and that a patient's identity is unlikely to be revealed by giving a breakdown of cases by city.""I think when people can't get information they freak out, they think something is being hidden from them, conspiracy theories grow, suspicions grow,"" he said. ""I think it's always better to be as truthful, calmly, and transparent with the public as you can be.""As an example, Mr. Cortese says he is alarmed that health officers have not made more information public on the coronavirus-related death of a homeless man in the county. Given the medical vulnerabilities of that population, doctors and advocates of homeless people have called his office demanding to know in which encampment the man lived so that they could advise other homeless people in the area to be more vigilant. The county, which refused to disclose that information, said in a statement that health officials screened 60 members of the ""specific community"" and tested nine symptomatic individuals for the coronavirus. All nine tests were negative, the county said.Mr. Cortese says it is obvious to him that more information on the spread of the pandemic should be shared.""At the height of the information age in Silicon Valley we have stumbled and fallen flat in terms of our ability to use the tools and resources that we have to get necessary information out to the people we serve,"" Mr. Cortese said.Frustration over the dearth of data also extends to epidemiologists trying to understand the dynamics of the spread of the virus.Joseph Lewnard, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, says researchers are hamstrung in the United States by the lack of specific data on testing and on the symptoms patients show.To make up for the lack of public data, researchers are scraping information on cases from news outlets and other media accounts, he said. They are mainly relying on data from South Korea, China and Italy to try to predict the spread of the virus.""We are right now learning and trying to project what is happening here in the United States almost entirely based on observations from these other countries,"" Prof. Lewnard said.Moritz Kraemer, a scholar at Oxford University who is leading a team of researchers in mapping the global spread of the coronavirus, says China's data ""provided incredible detail,"" including a patient's age, sex, travel history and history of chronic disease, as well as where the case was reported, and the dates of the onset of symptoms, hospitalization and confirmation of infection.The United States, he said, ""has been slow in collecting data in a systematic way.""Dr. C. Jason Wang, a researcher at Stanford University, who has studied how Taiwan handled the coronavirus outbreak, says some of the measures taken in Taiwan would most likely not be accepted in the United States given privacy concerns. The government, for example, merged the airport immigration database with the national medical database so that doctors could immediately see if a patient had traveled out of the country.But Dr. Wang says the proactive approach that Taiwan took to the virus, including aggressive tracing of cases, has helped keep the total number of confirmed infections -- 283 on Saturday -- much lower than experts initially expected. By comparison, the borough of Queens in New York City, with one-tenth the population of Taiwan, has 10,000 cases.Some of the information being released to the public in Taiwan and Singapore would most likely be uncontroversial in the United States, he said. Taiwanese authorities, for example, have pointed out linkages between anonymized cases, including family clusters, in an effort to warn the public how easily the virus is transmitted within households.Prof. Caplan of the N.Y.U. School of Medicine says it is paradoxical that the United States is providing less precise information to its citizens on the outbreak than Singapore, which puts limits on the spread of information through internet controls.""Here we expect to get information so we have our choices and we make our decisions,"" he said. ""Our notion is information is the oxygen for democracy. Wouldn't we want to receive more information than them?""PhotographLos Angeles County provides a rough age distribution of coronavirus patients, breaking down cases into more than 140 communities.

| Jump to first hitAlabama Montgomery: Lawmakers might lift a decades-old ban on yoga in the state’s public schools, but the bill would keep the greeting “namaste” on the forbidden list. The bill by Rep. Jeremy Gray, a Democratic legislator from Opelika, is on the proposed debate agenda Tuesday in the Alabama House of Representatives. The bill says that local school systems can decide if they want to teach yoga, poses and stretches. However, the moves and exercises taught to students must have exclusively English names, according to the legislation. It would also prohibit the use of chanting, mantras and teaching the greeting “namaste. ” The Alabama Board of Education in 1993 voted to prohibit yoga, hypnosis and meditation in public school classrooms. The ban was pushed by conservative groups. The ban got new attention in 2018 when an old document circulated listing yoga – along with games like tag – among inappropriate activities in gym class.  Alaska Anchorage: A federal commission has issued the final environmental impact statement for the $40 billion Alaska LNG Project. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released the document Friday that largely affirmed the plan proposed by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. , The Alaska Journal of Commerce reports. The Alaska LNG Project is the latest attempt to commercialize large volumes of North Slope natural gas. State and energy company officials have tried since the 1970s to compile a plan to produce and sell the gas considered “stranded” because the remote location lacks infrastructure to get the gas to local or global markets. AGDC and the state labor department have estimated the project would generate about 18,000 jobs during construction and about 1,000 new jobs during its 30-year operational life.  Arizona Marana: This isn’t much of a corn-growing state, but many future varieties of the plant will have their roots here. German conglomerate Bayer has unveiled a new greenhouse complex on 7 acres north of Tucson that will serve as a development and production site focused solely on corn seeds. Midwestern states lead the nation in corn production, but Arizona’s sunlight and temperatures offer ideal greenhouse growing conditions, according to the company. Plants will be grown indoors year-round. The $100 million facility in Marana will feature robots doing much of the seeding and re-potting work and automated watering systems that will recycle nearly all water. Plant pots are moved around on a conveyor system from a growth chamber to the greenhouse, hoisted where necessary by automated cranes. Plant pots periodically rotate on a carousel system to maximize growing conditions and make them more accessible to agronomists.  Arkansas Van Buren: State, local and federal officials gathered in western Arkansas last week to discuss the response to historic flooding along the Arkansas River in Arkansas and Oklahoma and ways to reduce damage in the future. Following the closed-door meeting Tuesday, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. Eric Noe said levees along the river “held up well” but need to be assessed for possible improvements, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. “That levee system is very, very good to protecting our communities,” Noe said. “It held up extremely well given the extreme flood conditions last year, but what we’re looking forward to is make sure they’re going to work in the future as well. ” The Corps in September proposed a $160 million plan to shore up levees around Tulsa that have been weakened by past flooding. The 2019 flooding that began in May inundated hundreds of homes and business along the river.  California Sacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom and his wife reported more than $1. 2 million in income during his final year as the state’s lieutenant governor, the majority of it from outside business interests. Newsom made good on a campaign promise by allowing reporters to review his 2018 income tax filing Friday. He also plans to release returns every year he’s governor. Newsom has not yet filed his 2019 taxes. Last year Newsom, a Democrat, signed a first-in-the-nation law that would have required President Donald Trump to release his returns if he were to appear on the state primary ballot. The California Supreme Court ultimately rejected it as unconstitutional. Newsom’s 2018 return showed nearly $394,000 in wages, of which about $151,000 was his state salary. His wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, is a filmmaker and actress with her own outside income, though the couple filed jointly.  Colorado Boulder: The University of Colorado’s Board of Regents violated the state’s Open Records Act last year in not releasing the names of six finalists for the job as the system’s president, a state judge ruled. The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder had requested the information in May and July and filed a lawsuit in September. District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones ruled Friday that the Board of Regents failed to show that it properly denied the newspaper’s request. He ordered regents to turn over the names and application materials of the six finalists to the newspaper within 21 days. “Judge Jones in his ruling upheld the public’s right to scrutinize the regents’ actions, as they are elected officials,” said Camera Senior Editor Julie Vossler-Henderson. System leaders were “digesting the ruling, and we’re considering our options,” spokesman Ken McConnellogue told the newspaper.  Connecticut Hartford: Ten major private-sector companies in the state have pledged to close the gender gap in corporate leadership over the next decade. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, who last year called on companies to support the priorities of the Governor’s Council on Women and Girls, lauded the 10 firms that have signed onto the national Paradigm for Parity pledge to achieve gender parity by 2030. “I applaud these companies for actively working towards fighting gender inequality in corporate leadership and for leading by example as the first ten companies in our state to sign the Paradigm for Parity Pledge,” Bysiewicz said in a statement. The participating companies include Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Cigna, CVS Health (including Aetna), Eversource Energy, Frontier Communications, KeyCorp/KeyBank, Stanley Black and Decker, Synchrony Financial, The Hartford, and United Technologies Corporation.  Delaware Dover: In an apparent testament to increased political interest, the state has about 61,540 more registered voters than it did four years ago. About 5,000 of those new voters are from the past three months, according to registration totals from the Department of Elections. The parties differ slightly on what is driving the increase. The state Democratic Party points to the upcoming presidential primary April 28. The state Republican Party, meanwhile, thinks citizens are hearing an increased urgency in the media that the 2020 election is important. Paul Brewer, research director at the University of Delaware’s Center for Political Communication, said part of Delaware’s increased engagement could be from the state’s growing population. It’s also likely a result of the “Trump phenomenon” that is mobilizing people who are for and against the president in his reelection bid, he said.  District of Columbia Washington: Police are looking for three men accused of shooting six people, including a child, at a barbershop. A 5-year-old boy who was grazed on his hand was among those wounded Friday evening at Snap’s barbershop, news outlets report. None of the injuries were considered life-threatening. One man had surgery and was listed in critical but stable condition, D. C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said. The suspects were described as three men who opened fire inside the barbershop and then left in a silver minivan. Police in Washington were working with nearby Prince George’s County police to search for the suspects.  Florida Weston: Authorities say a security guard accidentally shot a maintenance worker in the eye at a private school. The Broward County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that the security guard was not authorized to have a gun at the Sagemont School in Weston, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale. Investigators say the guard and the maintenance worker were in the school parking lot Thursday when the gun accidentally discharged, striking the maintenance worker. The guard drove the worker to a hospital, where deputies were notified. The sheriff’s office did not release the worker’s condition. Sagemont officials did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The Associated Press is not naming the guard because he has not been charged with a crime, but the shooting remains under investigation.  Georgia Savannah: Fountains are gushing water colored with bright green dye in the parks and oak-shaded squares of Georgia’s oldest city, signaling that its biggest celebration of the year is drawing near. Savannah has been celebrating St. Patrick’s Day with a parade for 196 years, and the tradition has ballooned into a lucrative tourist attraction that draws thousands to the city every March 17. Parade organizers gathered Friday to dump green dye into the wrought-iron fountain at Forsyth Park – and city workers likewise colored the water in other public fountains. It’s something Savannah has done for decades as part of its St. Patrick’s Day preparations. The 2020 parade will fall on a Tuesday but will be preceded by a St. Patrick’s festival the weekend before. Joe Marinelli of Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, said hotels are booked for high occupancy.  Hawaii Honolulu: A zoning proposal aimed at restricting the installation of energy-producing windmills has received preliminary approval from a city government committee. The Honolulu City Council Zoning Committee approved the resolution last week banning installation of the windmills within 5 miles of neighboring properties, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. City officials warned the change would essentially eliminate future development of wind farms anywhere on Oahu. The resolution must be passed by the full City Council before going into effect. Councilwoman Heidi Tsuneyoshi introduced the resolution in response to an outcry from residents in Kahuku over the development of the Na Pua Makani wind-power project. AES Corp. received city permits for the project, which includes eight high-wind turbines standing 568 feet. The turbines have been installed and are expected to be operational by summer.  Idaho Boise: State wildlife authorities are investigating a poaching incident after a sturgeon carcass was found in the Boise River. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game received the report of the carcass in the river near a Boise bridge March 3. A conservation officer who investigated found only the head and fins remained on the 6-foot sturgeon carcass. White sturgeon are a protected species in Idaho. They can be caught, but anglers are required to release them safely and without removing them from the water. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game is asking that people with any information about the incident call state law enforcement or department officials.  Illinois Glen Carbon: The Girl Scouts of Southern Illinois are selling four camps for $3. 4 million and closing them by the end of the year, a move that’s prompted complaints and concerns. Organization officials said the sale, first announced last month, is due to financial concerns. Chief Financial Officer Kelley Young said reserves have been used to cover years of deficit spending, according to The Belleville News-Democrat. Also, camp usage has declined. But Girls Scouts and leaders said the camps are ideal places to try canoeing, fishing and archery, activities that are hard to do elsewhere. Three of the facilities are in Illinois: Camp Wassatoga near Effingham, Camp Chan Ya Ta near Worden and Camp Torqua near Edwardsville. Theresa Wuebbels, a troop leader in Belleville, said it’s been a family tradition to attend the camps. She’s started a petition to save the camps, which thousands of people have signed.  Indiana Nappanee: The new owners of a popular northern Indiana tourist attraction that provides a glimpse into the life and history of the Amish have given it a new name that pays homage to the rural region’s plentiful barns. The site in Nappanee had been known as Amish Acres, but its new name is The Barns at Nappanee, according to former U. S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, who purchased most of the complex with two partners last month at an auction. The attraction site, located 30 miles southeast of South Bend, has drawn about 150,000 visitors annually to its historical cabins, barns and other structures, most of which date back to the 1800s. Richard Pletcher and other family members decided to sell the site and retire because maintaining it is “a year-round effort,” and they’re “all exhausted. ” The new owners revealed spring plans at the 400-seat Round Barn Theatre, which will open April 10.  Iowa Maquoketa: A federal agency intends to assume the monitoring of contamination from a carcinogenic chemical that’s spread from a factory site in this eastern Iowa city. The Telegraph Herald reports the Environmental Protection Agency is developing a plan for testing at the Clinton Engines Museum site and the surrounding area for potential groundwater and vapor contamination. Previous testing revealed groundwater contamination from trichloroethene. The contamination stems from the operations of Clinton Machine Co. , which built small engines in Maquoketa from 1950 into the 1990s. The factory used trichloroethene, commonly known as TCE, as a degreasing agent. Federal authorities have since determined TCE is carcinogenic. The city took over the site in 2000 and tore down much of the facility, leaving only the office building. It now houses the museum. Contaminants have been detected in groundwater up to two-thirds of a mile away.  Kansas Lawrence: Construction of a new $19. 5 million police headquarters in the city is now halfway complete. Officials celebrated the halfway mark Friday as the final piece of the structure’s steel framing was placed, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. City staff, police and city signed the steel beam and topped it with American flag and a small evergreen tree, intended to bring good fortune, during Friday’s ceremony. The new headquarters is expected to house about 90% of sworn police staff and include spaces for investigations, administration and the crime lab. The project was initially intended to be smaller, but city officials expanded it in the fall, enabling more functions and personnel to move into the building. “We think that there are some possibilities to get all of our people who are actively responding to calls or doing investigations in this building,” Police Capt. Anthony Brixius said.  Kentucky Hodgenville: The new superintendent at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park will meet with visitors during an open house this week. Catherine Bragaw plans to attend an open house Wednesday at the park’s visitor center, officials said in a news release. The free event is open to the public, and light refreshments will be provided. Bragaw, who has spent more than 30 years with the park service, took over at the Lincoln Birthplace in November. National Park Service Southeast Regional Director Robert A. Vogel said in a statement when Bragaw was named that her passion for political science, public history and civic engagement would help her manage how the park interprets the early years of the nation’s 16th president. Bragaw says she’s looking forward to meeting visitors and those from nearby communities.  Louisiana New Orleans: An anonymous $2 million donation will fund an endowed chair in Tulane University’s Department of Jewish Studies. The donation was announced in a news release by the private university in New Orleans. Michael Cohen, the chairman of the Department of Jewish Studies, said the gift will allow the department to add an internationally recognized scholar on the Jews’ role in the contemporary world. “Tulane University is becoming the international leader in understanding the essential role Jews have played in American culture and society,” Cohen said in the release. The donors were identified only as the parents of a recent Tulane graduate. The university said the gift will support a chair in the Stuart and Suzanne Grant Center for the American Jewish Experience.  Maine Orono: The state’s annual conference about grain production will put a focus on growing malt barley varieties for local brewers. The Maine Grain Conference is scheduled to take place Friday at the Black Bear Inn and Conference Center in Orono. The state is home to a large craft beer industry that has grown exponentially over the past decade. Other topics included in this year’s conference will include farming grain organically on Prince Edward Island, new marketing strategies, and the role of the University of Maine in growing the state’s grain business, organizers said. Presenters at the event are scheduled to include UMaine, UMaine Cooperative Extension, Cornell Cooperative Extension, the Maine Grain Alliance, malt house owners, brewers and others.  Maryland Salisbury: After weeks of urging federal officials to take action, Gov. Larry Hogan has confirmed the U. S. Department of Homeland Security’s announcement that it will release an additional 35,000 visas through the H-2B Nonimmigrant Temporary Worker Program. This will help protect Maryland’s $355 million seafood industry and supply chain, particularly ahead of the start of the blue crab harvest season April 1. Maryland’s Best Seafood, a marketing program within the state Department of Agriculture, released a survey last week measuring the economic impact of the state’s crab industry and the importance of the federal H-2B temporary visa program. All eight crab processors surveyed agreed that the current lottery system for awarding temporary visa requests creates uncertainty that hurts their businesses and that limiting the number of available H-2B visas hurts Maryland’s seafood industry as a whole. Seven of the eight crab companies indicated they would not open for the 2020 crab season without adequate H-2B workers.  Massachusetts Boston: Lawmakers and advocates are planning to gather at the Statehouse to push legislation that would ban body size discrimination. The bill is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Becca Rausch of Needham and Democratic Rep. Tram Nguyen of Andover. At an event at the Statehouse on Tuesday, Rausch and Tram plan to join advocates and eating disorder experts to talk about the hidden impact of weight discrimination in employment, health care and education. The bill aims to make discrimination on the basis of height and weight illegal in Massachusetts while also addressing body size stigma and the discrimination that often accompanies it. The bill would add to the state’s anti-discrimination laws the words “height or weight, unless for the purposes of compliance with any established state, federal, or industry safety standard,” along with other factors including race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.  Michigan Lansing: State officials say they want to help poor people avoid a driver’s license suspension for unpaid traffic tickets. A federal appeals court last year rejected a challenge to the suspension policy. But the attorney general’s office said a line will be added to tickets and court forms, telling people to contact the local court to arrange an alternative if they can’t afford to pay a fine. The language will be added no later than mid-February 2021. “I am proud that we are working to stop penalizing poverty,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. “There is a disconnect of logic in this law, and all Michiganders benefit when we make the justice system more fair. ” A task force that studied Michigan’s jail population recommends that licenses shouldn’t be suspended for reasons unrelated to safe driving.  Minnesota Minneapolis: Hundreds of janitors in the Twin Cities have reached a deal with their employers on a new contract, narrowly avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin this week. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that Service Employees International Union Local 26 reached the tentative agreement with employers Saturday morning. SEIU Local 26 represents 4,000 commercial janitors in the Twin Cities. They were set to strike Monday. The four-year contract includes wage increases of $2. 20 over the course of the agreement for full-time workers. Some part-timers will go from $11. 12 an hour to $16 over the life of the contract. All full-timers will get six paid sick days by the second year. The contract also reduces health insurance costs and incorporates sexual harassment policies. Janitors held a one-day strike in downtown Minneapolis last week, forming a picket line, waving signs and beating drums.  Mississippi Natchez: The Natchez Police Department is getting a new K9 officer. Police Chief Walter Armstrong said one of his officers is in week two of a five-week training program with the new K9, and both should be ready for duty toward the end of the month, The Natchez Democrat reports. The new K9 is replacing K9 Arko, who died in September at age 14. Ideally the department would have two K9s to work alternate shifts, Armstrong said, adding donations are still being accepted at the department for a second K9. Armstrong said an Arkansas couple donated approximately $16,300 that would completely fund the cost of one K9 and training after they learned about the department’s need during the Super Retriever Series Crown Championship – a competitive event for various dog breeds that took place on the Natchez bluff in September. Between $11,000 and $12,000 is still needed to purchase and train a second dog, Armstrong said.  Missouri St. Louis: Washington University has announced plans for a $616 million, 11-story building to house the university’s research on the human brain and nervous system. The 609,000-square-foot facility will be among the nation’s largest neuroscience research buildings, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. University officials announced the plans Friday, saying the project will bring together more than 100 research teams focused on the brain and nervous system. More than 900 researchers and staff members from the School of Medicine’s neurology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, psychiatry and anesthesiology departments are expected to move into the building by late 2023, university officials said. The university plans to finance most of the yet-to-be-named building through taxable bonds.  Montana Bozeman: Mountain snow moisture is near to above normal in the state. Record-setting snow in February made up for dry weather in November and December, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Statewide, snow moisture was 137% of normal compared to just 93% of normal around this time last year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Water Supply Outlook Report for March 1. Precipitation and temperatures over the remainder of winter and into spring will be critical for determining how much water will be available for irrigation and other uses this year, NRCS water supply scientist Lucas Zukiewicz said. Snowpack in the Gallatin River headwaters was 120% of normal, while snow feeding the Madison River was 99% of normal. Snowpack for the Upper Yellowstone drainage was 115% of normal. Jefferson River basin snowpack was at 113%.  Nebraska Lincoln: Rainbow trout will be stocked this month and in April at lakes and city ponds across the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said the trout are about 10 inches in length. The rainbow stockings began Monday at the Bridgeport State Recreation Area, at Terry’s Pit in Terrytown and the Scottsbluff zoo pond. Other stocking points include Auble Pound in Ord, Steinhart Park East Pond in Nebraska City and Such’s Lake in Grand Island. For more fishing and stocking information or to purchase a fishing permit, go online to the commission website.  Nevada Las Vegas: Firefighters have extinguished a fire that almost fully engulfed several palm trees in downtown Las Vegas. Fire crews responded about 8 a. m. Monday to the blaze, which was close to a one-story apartment building. There were no injuries, but there was some minor damage to the building and several power lines. NV Energy is repairing the lines. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Fire officials say the fire has led to two people and a dog being temporarily displaced.  New Hampshire Concord: A youth advisory council with participants ranging in age from 12 to 25 would make recommendations on policies, laws, and educational programs concerning climate, energy, conservation and recreation, according to a state senator’s bill. “New Hampshire’s youth will be affected by current and future decisions regarding climate change for the rest of their lives,” said Sen. David Watters, a Democrat from Dover who introduced the measure. “They rely on their governing bodies to take action to protect clean water, clean air, and the economic growth and workforce development that goes hand in hand with the creation of renewable energy jobs. ” The youth climate and conservation council would advise legislative leaders. It would include one resident of each county, plus four members each from middle school, high school, and college or university students. Each member would serve a two-year term.  New Jersey Trenton: Gov. Phil Murphy is back in the state and has resumed his duties as governor following surgery last week to remove what officials said was likely a cancerous tumor on his kidney. Murphy’s office said Sunday that he had resumed his duties as of Saturday evening. NJ. com reports he is expected to recuperate at his Middletown home over the next couple of weeks. Sheila Oliver, who was elected with Murphy as the state’s lieutenant governor in 2017, had been serving as acting governor. Murphy revealed that he had the tumor last month. The Democrat told NJ Advance Media in an interview, “We caught it early. We consider ourselves incredibly lucky. ” New Mexico Albuquerque: Nearly 1 in 5 fatal pedestrian crashes in the city last year occurred in a dimly lighted and highly congested section of historic Route 66 – an area plagued by poverty. An analysis by the Albuquerque Journal found that Albuquerque saw 42 deaths in 2019 related to fatal pedestrian collisions, and a significant number of these occurred in the area city officials call “forgotten. ” The nearly 3-mile stretch experienced eight pedestrian deaths last year. This dangerous section of Route 66 – Central Avenue between San Pedro and Eubank – is in a part of Albuquerque known for high crime rates, a large homeless population and outdated infrastructure. Often referred to as Albuquerque’s International District, the corridor lacks the same amount of street lights seen in more affluent parts of the city. It doesn’t appear the city is doing much to address the treacherous foyer.  New York New York: The number of coronavirus cases in the state jumped Sunday to more than 100, a spread that forced the suspension of classes at schools across New York, including a district that has a faculty member with a positive test and Columbia and Hofstra universities. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday that the city’s public health apparatus “is already planning on the assumption that we will be at hundreds of cases over the next two or three weeks. ” As of Sunday, the largest concentration of cases, 82, was in suburban Westchester County north of New York City. There were 13 cases in New York City, de Blasio said. A scattering of others were upstate in Saratoga County, on Long Island, and in Rockland and Ulster counties. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow private laboratories to do testing to greatly expand the number of tests that can be done.  North Carolina Grady: A blind wild horse that had roamed the Outer Banks has died. The Virginian-Pilot reports Amadeo passed away Friday. The horse was once considered a king of the undeveloped beaches north of Corolla. Before he lost his sight, he was well known as a stallion who fought for his harem of mares. He already was blind in one eye when a stallion damaged his other eye. He ran into the ocean and was carried away in a riptide before an ocean rescue team got him back to shore. Amadeo retired to a farm in Grandy for aging wild horses, becoming a visitor favorite and appearing to enjoy interacting with people, including children. In recent weeks, Amadeo became increasingly stiff and unable to move freely. The Corolla Wild Horse Fund said he couldn’t get up after a fall and died quickly and peacefully. “Rest free and easy, sweet boy,” the fund said.  North Dakota Fargo: In the decade since the city agreed to host a sweat lodge for the many Native Americans who live in the area, the simple structure and its users have suffered a series of indignities: The land set aside for the lodge is in a gritty industrial area, a shirtless user was mistaken for a vagrant and arrested, and police mistook the lodge for a homeless encampment and had it bulldozed. Now, the city has shuttered the lodge because of concerns about its safety and supervision, and the Native Americans who use it are worried about how they will be able to carry out their sacred healing ritual, even if many of them agree that changes were needed. Sweat lodges are typically built low to the ground, with frames made of saplings that are covered with animal hides, blankets or even tarps to keep in the steam. They are common on reservations but less so in urban areas such as Fargo.  Ohio Dayton: Data shows the city’s decision to pull the plug on its fixed red light and speed-detection cameras resulted in a dramatic reduction in fines. The city is still using some speed cameras in school zones but halted use of its fixed traffic cameras that record violations and result in citation notices a few months ago, the Dayton Daily News reports. Photo-enforcement citations hit a high of 8,949 in May. But after the cameras were no longer being used in September, citations fell to 609 and then dropped to 492 in October, police data shows. John Musto, Dayton’s chief trial counsel, said the city’s photo enforcement program remains active but has been modified to focus on traffic enforcement in school zones. Officials have been using mobile speed trailers to issue those citations, which doubled in November and then nearly quadrupled in December.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: Two civil rights groups said Monday that they intend to sue the state if the Legislature passes a bill to prohibit state contracts with companies that boycott Israel. Attorneys with the Oklahoma chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and Council on American-Islamic Relations both say House Bill 3967, which passed the House last week, is unconstitutional. The bill provides that the state not enter into contracts with companies that advocate boycotts, divestments or sanctions against Israel. The bill’s author, Republican Rep. Mark McBride of Moore, says the measure recognizes Israel as an important trading partner and ally in the Middle East. Mike Redman, the interim director of ACLU of Oklahoma, said the U. S. Supreme Court has recognized that economic and political boycotts are a form of political speech enshrined and protected by the First Amendment.  Oregon Salem: The Oregon Department of Transportation is conducting engineering reviews of 22 weigh stations after an internal investigation last year determined two program managers altered and reused engineering plans, did not inspect finished projects and more. The questionable work at all of the “weigh-in-motion” stations could put the safety of ODOT employees and the public at risk, Amy Ramsdell, ODOT’s Motor Carrier Transportation Division administrator, said in pre-disciplinary notices sent in December 2019 to the then-managers, David McKane, 60, and David Fifer, 63, both of Keizer. “Your disregard of state statute, administrative rule, policy, procedure and guidelines have, and will continue to, unnecessarily cost the agency time and money; to what extent is unknown but the concerns are mounting,” Ramsdell wrote in the notices.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: The invasive spotted lanternfly is continuing its westward march across the state, with agriculture officials nearly doubling the number of counties in a quarantine zone meant to limit the pest’s spread. A dozen counties were added to the list last week, including Allegheny and Beaver in western Pennsylvania, several counties in the central region, and Luzerne and Columbia in the northeast. The additional counties are not “completely infested,” according to the agriculture department, but individual municipalities are battling the pest. Twenty-six of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are now under quarantine, requiring businesses that move products, vehicles and other items in and out of the quarantine zone to obtain a permit. Native to Asia, the large, colorful plant-hopper sucks sap from valuable trees and vines, weakening them. It produces a clear, sticky, sugary waste.  Rhode Island North Kingstown: Rhode Island Air National Guard’s new fire department opened after plans to replace the original building began nearly a decade ago. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held Saturday for the new Quonset facility that houses firefighters as well as a training site, WPRI reports. The original building was constructed in 1981, and plans for its reconstruction began in 2011. The project came to fruition years later with the partnership between the state’s Air National Guard, state agencies and the Military Construction Cooperative Agreement to help fund the project. “This is the first time the RIANG has carried out a project this way,” said Lt. Col. Kathleen Mahoney, the 143rd Base Civil Engineer, and Civil Engineer Squadron commander. “It feels so good that we could carry out something that was a vision 10 years ago. ” South Carolina Columbia: The state’s $10 billion spending plan will get a thorough review before a vote this week in the state House. House members came back for a rare Monday session to take up routine matters before starting the main part of the debate Tuesday. The spending plan includes $213 million to give a $3,000-a-year raise for every teacher and $128 million set aside so every South Carolina tax filer would get a $100 rebate. The budget also includes $100 million to pave and repair rural roads and $50 million for a state disaster relief fund that can be tapped for floods, storms or other disasters either before federal help comes or if the damage isn’t widespread enough for federal money. One certain fight will be over raises for state employees. The budget currently includes $42 million for raises but lets agency leaders decide who gets extra pay.  South Dakota Sioux Falls: Members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe will vote this week on legalizing medical and recreational marijuana on the Pine Ridge Reservation in an initiative that many hope will bring economic development to one of the most impoverished areas in the country. Neither South Dakota nor nearby Wyoming and Nebraska have legalized marijuana, and tribal leaders think pot could rake in millions of dollars. If the measure is approved, the Oglala Sioux Tribe would become the only Native American tribe to set up a cannabis market in a state where it’s otherwise illegal. “People will be coming in from all directions to get their medicine,” said Ricky Gray Grass, a tribal leader. The Oglala Sioux Tribe is poised to test federal and state policy. Members will vote Tuesday on whether to approve medical marijuana, recreational marijuana and allowing alcohol at the tribe’s casino. The tribal council is then supposed to implement any changes voters approve.  Tennessee Nashville: Three influential singing groups and a late Nashville record executive will be inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame this spring. The Nashville-based Gospel Music Association will induct four new figures into the hall: 4Him, Commissioned and The Isaacs, along with a posthumous induction for Capitol Christian Music Group CEO Bill Hearn. All will be recognized at the seventh annual GMA Honors and Hall of Fame Induction, set to take place May 6 in Nashville. The ceremony also recognizes charitable efforts, organizations and their leaders, often tied to the Christian music community. This year’s honorees are Chris Tomlin for Angel Armies, Steve Moore for The Shalom Foundation, Wes Campbell and Dave Wagner for Thriving Children’s Foundation, and Willie Moore Jr. for Bethany Christian Services. More information is available online.  Texas Dallas: The elections administrator for Dallas County is asking a court to allow for a paper recount of votes cast electronically in the county on Super Tuesday. Toni Pippins-Poole said in a news release that she requested the recount Friday after discrepancies were found with thumb drives in 44 of the county’s scanner and tabulation machines located at the county’s 454 precincts. The Dallas Morning News first reported that Pippins-Poole stated in an affidavit that the number of ballots signed by voters does not match the number of ballots counted on the 44 thumb drives. It was not immediately clear how many votes might not have been counted. Pippins-Poole said a paper ballot backup system is included in the county’s electronic voting machines. Elections officials will “make the results available to the public as quickly as possible” if the court grants the recount request, Pippins-Poole said.  Utah Ogden: A proposal to limit the use of cash bail is advancing in the Legislature, with supporters saying changes are needed to prevent people who are presumed innocent from getting stuck behind bars because they don’t have money for bail. The plan to create a presumption of release for low-risk suspects has passed the House and is being considered by the Senate, the Standard-Examiner reports. The bill has support from prosecutors, sheriffs, defense attorneys and the courts. But there is opposition from the bail bond industry and some lawmakers who have said the existing system is too lenient. Passing the bill could avoid the possibility of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Utah’s monetary bail system, which has happened in several other states, said the bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Pitcher.  Vermont Burlington: A ferry company that transports passengers and vehicles across Lake Champlain between Vermont and New York wants to see a century-old vessel turned into an underwater scuba diving destination just off the Burlington waterfront. The Lake Champlain Transportation Company is hoping to donate the now-retired ferry “Adirondack,” constructed in 1913, to the state of Vermont so it could become the latest addition to an underwater historic preserve. Ferry company Operations Manager Heather Stewart called sinking the vessel that has carried passengers across Lake Champlain since 1954 “bittersweet,” but it’s better than the most practical alternative, selling it for scrap. “We are saying goodbye. All of us here, the thought of her getting scrapped is an unpleasant thought,” she said. “But to preserve her and for her to be part of the marine preserve would be great. ” Virginia Richmond: Lawmakers gave final passage Friday to a sweeping energy bill that would overhaul how the state’s utilities generate electricity, a measure environmental groups and other renewable energy advocates considered a historic step toward addressing climate change. The state Senate advanced the Virginia Clean Economy Act on a vote of 22-17, sending the bill to Gov. Ralph Northam a day after the House passed it. The measure was a top priority of leaders of the new Democratic majority that took control of the General Assembly in last fall’s elections. “Today, the Virginia Senate finalized what would have been impossible just a year ago: comprehensive legislation that gets us to 100 percent clean electricity and zero carbon emissions,” Michael Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. The bill passed over the objections of many Republicans, who raised concerns about impacts on ratepayers.  Washington Olympia: The state Senate on Saturday unanimously passed a measure that exempts feminine hygiene products from the state’s sales and use tax. The measure now heads to the House for consideration. Under the bill, products that are exempt from the tax include sanitary napkins, tampons, menstrual cups or any other similar menstrual product. The measure was part of the Senate supplemental budget plan, and lawmakers are working to pass bills and negotiate a final budget with the House before the Legislature adjourns Thursday. Washington is currently among 31 states that still tax menstrual products, according to Period Equity, a nonprofit group that is campaigning to end the so-called tampon tax in states across the nation.  West Virginia Morgantown: West Virginia University has a new mountaineer. The college named sophomore Colson Glover as its 67th mountaineer mascot at the school’s Saturday game against Baylor. “There is no bigger honor or privilege than for me to serve the people of my state and university while showing the world why West Virginia is termed ‘Almost Heaven,’ ” Glover said in a news release. The neuroscience major will officially don the mountaineer’s coonskin cap, buckskins and rifle at the Gold-Blue Spring Game on Saturday, April 18. The Lewisburg native said it’s been a lifelong dream to be the mascot. “Throughout my childhood I have always idolized and admired the Mountaineer mascot with hopes that I too might wear the buckskins,” he said. The mountaineer mascot first appeared at the college’s sporting events in the 1934-1935 school year, according to WVU.  Wisconsin Madison: Five University of Wisconsin campuses are phasing out coal as a heat source this year and will transition to using a combination of natural gas and heating oil. In June, the UW System will end its statewide contract to provide coal for campuses. Stout, Oshkosh, Platteville, Stevens Point and Superior campuses have upgraded their remaining coal-fired boilers to run mainly on natural gas with a fuel oil backup. UW-Platteville sustainability coordinator Amy Seebooth-Wilson tells Wisconsin Public Radio the campus will stop using coal at the end of March. “And it turns out this conversion among our heat plant to switch away from coal is going to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions related to heat by approximately 20%,” Seeboth-Wilson said. UW-Oshkosh will hold a ceremony celebrating the end of its ties with coal Thursday.  Wyoming Fort Washakie: Advocates for legalizing medical marijuana have been pressing their case in the days before a possible vote this weekend on the Wind River Reservation. The Eastern Shoshone, who share the central Wyoming reservation with the Northern Arapaho Tribe, could vote on the issue Saturday during a meeting of the tribe’s General Council, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Legal medical marijuana and industrial hemp production could diversify the reservation economy, create jobs and offer another medical treatment option, advocates have said. A number of U. S. tribes have legalized marijuana and industrial hemp in pursuit of economic and medical benefits. Eastern Shoshone officials have said they do not plan to legalize recreational marijuana. Wyoming law prohibits medical or recreational marijuana, and marijuana remains illegal under federal law. But the U. S. Department of Justice since 2014 has treated tribes similarly to states and has not interfered with loosened tribal cannabis laws.

Middle-class Americans are forsaking marriage amid financial insecurity, effectively making the institution more of a luxury good enjoyed by prosperous Americans.
The middle three-fifths of U.S. earners have experienced the sharpest declines in marriage rates over the past four decades compared with people at the bottom of the income ladder and those at the top, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of census data from 1980 to 2018, the most recent available. These households earned from $25,000 to $125,000 in 2018.
Affluent Americans who marry are more likely to pool six-figure incomes, buy homes and watch their assets grow. Among people ages 25 to 34, the median wealth of married couples is four times that of couples who live together but aren't married, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The divide reflects another facet of the nation's income gap.
More couples are deciding to live together instead of marrying, and strained finances are a top reason many cite. A survey last year by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that among those who live with a partner and wish to get married, more than half said they or their partner weren't financially ready.
""Economic conditions, even in the good economy, remain difficult for many working Americans,"" said Daniel Schneider, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied marriage. ""That is not conducive to you feeling like you could get married, or people wanting to marry you.""
Marriage remains a goal for most young Americans. Every year since 1976, University of Michigan researchers have asked high-school seniors across the U.S. whether they expect to marry: Three-quarters of them said yes in 2017, a share virtually unchanged since the first survey, according to an analysis by Bowling Green State University of the survey data.
Now, many young adults no longer see marriage as the first rung on the ladder to adulthood. Instead, they want to first start careers, or at least land secure jobs and have some money in their pocket.
""The meaning of marriage has changed, and marriage is now viewed as this capstone achievement once all of these other milestones have been achieved,"" said Susan L. Brown, chair of sociology at Bowling Green State. ""It's almost like a luxury good that's attainable only by the people who have the highest resources in society.""
About half of middle earners were married in 2018, a drop of 16 percentage points since 1980. Among the highest U.S. earners, 60% were married in 2018, a decline of 4 percentage points over the same period. That marks a reversal. In 1980, a higher proportion of middle-class Americans than top earners were married.
The poorest Americans, those with incomes under $25,000, remain the least likely to marry, but their marriage rates haven't budged since 2005.
Stagnant wages and lost manufacturing jobs, especially since the financial crisis, have eroded the financial security that helped previous generations of working-class Americans form married households, researchers said.
Nick Cotter, 31 years old, grew up in Pittsburgh's Brookline neighborhood. His father was an electrician, and his mother worked raising four children. The family usually went to Catholic Church services at least twice a week.
Mr. Cotter faced bleak prospects after finishing high school in 2007. He worked as a supermarket stock boy at minimum wage until he was 21. He tried college before dropping out, in part because he couldn't afford it.
His low-skill, low-wage job wasn't conducive to dating, much less marriage, he said: ""When you don't feel that good about yourself, you definitely don't think other people will think that much of you.""
He took a second crack at college and received a bachelor's degree from Wheeling University in West Virginia in 2013. He eventually got a master's degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon University. He now works as a local government researcher on affordable housing and neighborhoods.
Mr. Cotter is hopeful he will find the right partner. ""I feel like if I ever get married it would probably be because of the tax benefits, or if they really wanted to,"" he said. ""That's a definite change from what my parents thought.""
The marriage gap by education level is also widening.
The share of high-school-educated adults who are married has fallen 19 percentage points since 1980, while declining 8 percentage points for those with a four-year degree, the Journal found. Among Americans ages 25 and older, nearly two-thirds with a college degree are married, compared with just half of those with a high-school education or less.
Couples living together are under less pressure from family and friends to tie the knot than in the past. The steady decline in mainstream religion helped remove the stigma once assigned unmarried couples living together.
More couples are forming families without matrimony. One in four parents living with a child is unmarried, according to Pew. More than one-third of them are living with a partner, up from one in five in 1997, the Pew study of 2017 data found.
Some churches are expanding marriage-support services over concerns that falling rates of matrimony are a main reason fewer people go to church.
""Family decline is what's driving faith decline,"" said J.P. De Gance, president and chief executive of Communio, a nonprofit in Alexandria, Va. The group helps churches build ministries that encourage healthy marriages and relationships.
The shadow of divorce might also play a role. People born from 1965 to 1980, Generation X, as well as millennials, born from 1981 to 1996, grew up in the era when such breakups became common. Their childhood experiences sowed cynicism about marriage for some, experts said. The U.S. divorce rate, after peaking in 1979, is now at a 40-year low.
The decline in marriage has been pronounced in metropolitan areas where manufacturing jobs have dried up, places such as Janesville, Wis.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Utica, N.Y.; and Bangor, Maine.
David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and co-authors studied areas in the U.S. hurt by China's economic rise. They determined that job losses shrank the supply of economically secure young adult men, spurring a decline in marriage and childbearing.
One explanation is that the diminished economic power of men makes them less likely to marry and, driving this dynamic, the men may be less motivated to work because they aren't married. That was the subject of a paper published last year by Ariel Binder and John Bound of the University of Michigan economics department. They looked at a decadeslong decline in labor-force participation among men in their prime working years without college degrees.
Mr. Binder said these men, anticipating a worse marriage market, may not work as hard because they don't see themselves helping support a wife and family.
Meanwhile, their most-likely marriage partners, women without a college degree, have closed the earnings gap with male peers even faster than women with higher levels of education, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The earnings shift has reduced the economic motivation for these women to marry. ""The whole notion of a commitment device to keep the high-earning men around is not as crucial,"" said Shelly Lundberg, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
In Decatur, Ill., where the number of manufacturing jobs has declined 40% since 2000, barely half of high-school-educated people age 25 and older are married, down from 60% in 2000.
Jeanette Dlouhy, a 36-year-old emergency-room technician, and Troy Pulliam, a 43-year-old drug counselor, moved in together in 2018.
They said they want to get married but are holding off because Ms. Dlouhy is enrolled in a publicly funded program that pays for her to earn a nursing license. Combining their income could jeopardize that assistance, she said, as well as her state health-insurance subsidies.
""I don't think I could feed my kids if I didn't get help,"" she said.
Ms. Dlouhy is twice divorced with five children. She earned good grades in high school and dreamed of becoming a lawyer but never followed through with college. Mr. Pulliam is a divorced father of three. He had a series of skilled manufacturing jobs before becoming a drug counselor. She makes $13.25 an hour. He makes $20 an hour.
Ms. Dlouhy said that their living arrangement has made her reluctant to take a leadership position at their evangelical church. ""I know that I don't live right based on what I believe in,"" she said.
To show their commitment, she and Mr. Pulliam exchanged wedding bands. Hers is inscribed ""His Queen."" His ring says, ""Her King.""
Even among middle-class couples on relatively secure financial footing, some don't feel an urgency to marry.
Laura Supica, 39, said she met ""the man I will definitely grow old with"" when she served Chris Peary a drink seven years ago while working as a bartender in Bangor, Maine. They got a dog and a cat, bought a second house -- a fixer-upper Mr. Peary is renovating and helped pay for -- and made plans for a life together.
Ms. Supica now works as an administrative assistant in state government, and Mr. Peary, 39, is a proofreader and printing technician at the University of Maine. Together, they bring home about $83,000 a year and don't expect to marry. ""I feel like my needs are met,"" Ms. Supica said.
The couple said the main drawback of their arrangement is that Mr. Peary has few if any legal rights to the two houses that are in Ms. Supica's name. ""I certainly have concerns about what would happen if we break up,"" he said.
Mr. Schneider, the UC Berkeley sociologist, found that men and women in jobs with standard schedules and fringe benefits were more likely to marry. Differences in job quality accounted for as much as a quarter of the greater propensity to marry among people with at least a bachelor's degree compared with those with less than a high school diploma, according to a 2019 paper by Mr. Schneider and two co-authors.
Finding stable jobs helped pave the way to marriage for Tilah Larson and Jeff W. Mohrmann. They became a couple while enrolled at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland and graduated a year apart during the recession.
Unable to find professional jobs, they each moved back in with their parents -- hers in Wisconsin, his in Colorado. Ms. Larson worked at a high-end retailer, and Mr. Mohrmann worked as a repairman on a railroad track.
After Mr. Mohrmann landed a job at a law firm in Colorado Springs, Colo., in 2009, Ms. Larson moved there and found work as an analyst for the city parks department. ""It kind of felt like we had found our places, our careers,"" Ms. Larson, 39, said. They married in 2014 and now earn a combined income of about $210,000 a year.
Colorado Springs has one of the highest rates of marriage among college-educated adults of any metropolitan area in the U.S. -- about 72% of people ages 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or more, the Journal found.
Matrimony spurred the couple to set long-term financial goals, including paying off their six-figure student debt, saving for retirement and acquiring income-generating rental property.
Last year, they bought a four-bedroom duplex. They plan to rent the second unit on Airbnb and expect to get as much as $200 a night. In the next five years they want to buy a house in New Orleans to rent, as well as use for vacations.
Mr. Mohrmann, 38, said that having the stability of Ms. Larson's paycheck made it easier for him to start his own law practice and then become a financial adviser.
He said his wife's financial habits have rubbed off. ""If I would have married a less frugal woman,"" he said, ""I would have been broke by now.""

Dakar, Senegal - Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Senegal have jumped from zero to four in recent days, the most in a sub-Saharan African country, raising fears that upcoming religious festivals could fuel a wider outbreak.
Hundreds of thousands of people plan to travel through Senegal this month on pilgrimages as global health officials urge against large gatherings.
The risk of spread is ""very, very high,"" said Ousmane Faye, the chief virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, ""because of all the traffic we have from Europe, from China, from all over.""
The World Health Organization's Africa arm advised keeping a ""social distance"" of at least three feet, warning that outbreaks could ""overwhelm"" dozens of nations continentwide. 
China, where the new coronavirus was first detected, remains the hardest-hit country, with more than 80,000 infections and more than 3,000 deaths. South Korea and Italy are also battling rampant transmission, with 6,000 and 3,000 cases of infection, respectively. In sub-Saharan Africa, as of Friday morning, Nigeria, South Africa and Cameroon had each reported one case. 
Anxiety that is roiling life abroad has erupted on the continent's westernmost point. Hand sanitizer and bleach are vanishing from shelves, and hundreds of people have received orders to quarantine themselves.
The Basketball Africa League postponed the launch of its inaugural season, which was to take place in the coming week in the seaside capital, and Youssou Ndour, whom Rolling Stone once called the ""most famous singer alive"" in Senegal, canceled his shows. 
Senegalese President Macky Sall met with more than 60 imams Thursday at the Islamic Institute of Dakar, where they discussed the coronavirus, but officials stopped short of halting religious gatherings, saying they would closely monitor the threat.

Only in the event of an emergency would authorities suspend the religious observances, which are seen as deeply private affairs, said Oumar Diene, the secretary general of the National Association of Imams and Ulama of Senegal, a Muslim leaders network.
""But we are not there yet,"" he said.
The government, however, banned public celebrations of International Women's Day planned for this weekend. 
Medical workers have expressed concern that pilgrimages could heighten exposure among the most vulnerable: people outside the realm of big-city resources, in areas where medical facilities tend to lack isolation rooms, respiratory equipment and reliable electricity.
Senegalese officials say ambulances are ready to pick up and test anyone with symptoms of covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. The country's health ministry, meanwhile, is working with religious leaders to promote good hygiene practices and is publicizing emergency hotline numbers and ramping up support in poorer communities.
Nearly 40 percent of Senegalese live off the power grid, according to the World Bank's latest data, and a third subsist on less than $2 per person per day.
But some who live just minutes away from hospitals in town feel unwelcome, they say, because of previous experience, including being turned away because they couldn't pay upfront for malaria testing.
Sub-Saharan Africa recorded its first eight cases of coronavirus infection over the past two weeks, all of which came from Europe - France, Italy and England. Most patients left their arrival airports before showing symptoms, authorities say.
Health investigators are tracking down the other passengers on the infected people's flights, as well as others who work and live in areas they visited, and are asking them to remain at home or in hospitals for quarantine or treatment.
Senegal is approximately 95 percent Muslim, and most people belong to Sufi brotherhoods with centuries of history and enormous political power.
Visitors are expected to pour in this month from as far away as Europe and North America for the pilgrimages. The president normally sends delegations.
The timing worries Aida Diop, the head of nursing at a health center in Dakar's Fann neighborhood.
""Everyone's getting together,"" she said, ""and we don't know how, exactly, to treat this yet.""
Aliou Diack, 36, a streetside coffee seller, planned to take a bus Thursday to Touba, a holy city east of Dakar, for this week's celebration. The new coronavirus didn't scare him.
""Nothing can stop me,"" he said.
Along the coast, Abdoulaye Thiaw Laye, the guardian of the Layene brotherhood's land - a slice of beach in the capital city with a holy cave - shared guidance with followers from his oceanfront tent: If you're sick, stay home.


In three weeks, thousands of worshipers are expected to convene where he sat. 
They will wash their hands frequently, he said, and keep an eye on poorer members, who can't always afford to protect themselves.
""The lack of money is the real disease,"" Laye said.
He led a special prayer in the past week.
""May the coronavirus shrink to nothing before it reaches this shore,"" he said, ""and everywhere else.""
Four miles south, the covid-19 patients - all in stable condition - received treatment at a Fann hospital.
 Raymond Kajomes, 53, straddled his Yamaha motorcycle nearby and called to a friend, ""Hey! The coronavirus is right behind us.""
""When I'm working, I put on my gloves,"" said Kajomes, who makes his living as a document courier. ""It could be anywhere.""
His friend, Moustapha Niang, nodded in agreement. 

The painter, 50, worried about his wife, a traveling Italian nurse, who was delivering babies at the moment in her home country. All the schools in Italy had just closed. 
Would she get back okay? Would she face stigma?
""I'm going to give it a month,"" he said, ""and then I want to go to Italy and make sure everything is fine.""
Niang knew his inner circle could survive an outbreak. He wondered what would happen to some of his neighbors, who clean luxury hotels.
""I think of the panic in the poor populations,"" Ndiaye said. ""In general, they have to wait longer, or doctors won't treat them until they can pay.""
Kader Diagne, a carpenter down the road, intended to take aspirin if he felt sick. Unless illness prevented him from picking up a hammer, he'd rather avoid the doctor.
""I haven't been to a hospital,"" he said, ""since the day I was born in 1966.""

| Jump to first hitAlabama Montgomery: More than two dozen Alabama law professors and former law enforcement officers urged Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday to reduce the number of inmates in state prisons, warning that a COVID-19 outbreak in correctional facilities could create a “public health catastrophe. ” In a letter to Ivey, the signatories urged the governor to use her emergency powers to restart parole hearings with proper health precautions in place and focus on the release of prisoners age 50 or older and those with compromised immune systems. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Alabama neared 1,000 as reported deaths continued to climb, and a federal judge ruled the state could not prohibit abortions during the outbreak, granting a temporary restraining order to prevent the state from shutting down abortion clinics as a nonessential medical service during the outbreak.  Alaska Juneau: Alaskans who found themselves suddenly out of work or working reduced hours because of shutdowns related to the coronavirus were buoyed by news last week that lawmakers had proposed paying a $1,000 stimulus check to residents. Checks would have gone to residents who received Alaska Permanent Fund dividends last year – most Alaskans – regardless of need. But the stimulus check was removed from the compromise version of a budget advanced by House and Senate negotiators, leaving some lawmakers upset. Rep. Cathy Tilton of Wasilla, in a floor speech before the package passed the House early Sunday, said people got their hopes up after the Senate inclusion of the payment. “I believe in expectation management, Mr. Speaker, and shame on us because we got their expectations up,” said Tilton, a minority Republican. Other lawmakers said they were trying to be careful stewards with the state’s resources.  Arizona Phoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday imposed a stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, to take effect at the close of business Tuesday. But he said grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential services will remain open, and restaurants will continue takeout service. The order doesn’t prevent people from going to medical appointments or seeking other essential services from a long list he outlined last week. He also discouraged hoarding. “They will remain open, and everyone should continue to buy one week’s worth of groceries for one week’s worth of needs,” he said. The governor said he took the action after the state’s top health official said it was necessary to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus. Dr. Cara Christ, who oversees the Department of Health Services, said the rate of cases being seen in emergency rooms has been steadily rising from 2% to nearly 7% of all visits. The governor said people should still enjoy the outdoors, while practicing social distancing.  Arkansas Little Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Monday that he has approved an additional $45 million to purchase protective equipment for medical providers and for ventilators due to the coronavirus. The money is in addition to $30 million previously approved for protective equipment used by medical staff and others responding to coronavirus patients. Hutchinson said the extra money will be used when the equipment becomes available as the state competes with others, including hot spots such as New York City and New Orleans, for scarce supplies. “We can place an order, (and) the Department of Defense might come in and say, ‘We need that,’ or it might be New York offering a premium,” Hutchinson said.  California Los Angeles: The state is recruiting thousands of retired health care workers along with medical and nursing students to help as emergency hospitals that could include sites like the Los Angeles Coliseum and other sports arenas handle an anticipated flood of coronavirus patients, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. He signed an executive order to temporarily expand the health care workforce to staff the facilities that will supply the 50,000 hospital beds he estimated could be needed when the surge peaks. State models now estimate the peak occurring in mid-May. The state will waive certain professional licensing and certification requirements to get workers in the field faster. “If you’re a nursing school student, a medical school student, we need you,” Newsom said. “If you’ve just retired in the last few years, we need you. ” Colorado Denver: The spread of coronavirus cases in the state has slowed following the closure of bars and restaurants, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday as he urged people to continue to stay at home as much as possible until the outbreak is brought under control. Before bars and restaurants were ordered closed March 16, the number of coronavirus patients was doubling about every two days, but the doubling time has now slowed to about five days, Polis said. The impact of the statewide stay-at-home order he issued last week will not be seen until mid-April, he said. Polis said people should get outside close to home but not treat the shutdown in normal business to slow the spread of the virus as a “vacation” to venture farther. He quoted a Bible verse from Corinthians on the importance of faith, hope and love in asking residents to keep themselves and others safe and also in checking on neighbors who might need help and staying in touch with friends and family remotely.  Connecticut Hartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he’s considering narrowing the list of businesses considered essential to keep people home, predicting April will be a “horrible month” for coronavirus cases in Connecticut. Lamont said more needs to be done to persuade young people that social distancing is crucial to reducing the spread of the virus, noting the infection rate is expected to peak in the state over the coming weeks. “We’re definitely at a point where you’ve got to stay home, and probably we have to take a look at what is an essential worker and to continue to tighten that up in terms of any possible confusion,” Lamont said during an interview on WPLR FM. “I’m looking at more ways to keep people at home, at least for this 30-day period. ” Lamont said he’s been hesitant to close the state’s large parks but worries when he sees large groups of young people congregating, such as playing basketball, and not taking social distancing seriously.  Delaware Wilmington: More than 500 members of the state’s most vulnerable population – those without homes and stable medical care – have been contacted and assessed by state and health officials in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, a Wilmington hotel has stepped up and opened its door to house those considered most at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19, the disease derived from this new coronavirus that is spreading rapidly throughout the state. It’s all part of an effort to bring medical and social services under one roof – in this case, at this downtown hotel. The state Department of Health and Social Services declined to name the hotel. Officials said caring for this population can also bring about stigma, and they did not want to draw added attention to the location.  District of Columbia Washington: Several inmates at the D. C. Department of Corrections have tested positive for the coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. The latest inmate to test positive is a 37-year-old man who has been in quarantine since Thursday. Two positive cases are a 37-year-old and 38-year-old, according to D. C. Department of Corrections. Both were housed in the Correctional Treatment Facility, D Building. They were moved to the quarantine unit Thursday as a precautionary measure after an individual from their unit tested positive for COVID-19. The other two inmates to test positive for the virus are a 44-year-old man – not housed in the same unit with the first positive case – and a 20-year-old man, who was confirmed to have the virus March 25, DOC officials said.  Florida Fort Lauderdale: The state’s congressional Democrats on Tuesday blasted Gov. Ron DeSantis’ refusal to issue a statewide stay-at-home order to combat the coronavirus outbreak, charging that his “lax” decision will result in thousands of unnecessary deaths, risks the health of doctors and nurses, and threatens to overwhelm hospitals. With Florida now having at least 6,300 infections, 76 deaths and 770 hospitalizations, the Democrats said the Republican governor must drop his county-by-county approach and follow other hard-hit states by closing all nonessential businesses and ordering people to stay home except for buying food or medicine, visiting a doctor or going to an essential job. “Governor, we need you to follow the science – it is reckless and irresponsible to put at risk the people of the State of Florida who you swore to protect,” Rep. Donna Shalala of Miami said during a conference call with reporters. DeSantis has said he hasn’t issued a statewide order because he believes his county-by-county approach works medically, and he doesn’t want to punish businesses and workers in small, rural counties that have no or few confirmed cases.  Georgia Atlanta: Confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus in the state continued to increase Monday, as traveling to Savannah on the coast and into neighboring Florida became more cumbersome, and one expert predicted Georgia’s daily toll will keep escalating until late April. The Georgia Department of Public Health reported Tuesday that confirmed cases of the new virus have topped 3,800 statewide. Roughly 1 in 4 of those infected has been hospitalized, and at least 100 people have died. Dougherty County in southwest Georgia had at least 18 deaths, the most of any Georgia county, and continued to have the state’s highest per capita infection rate. Of the 12 counties with the highest per capita rates, 10 were in southwest Georgia. Bill Mathis, the elected chairman of neighboring Lee County, urged people to minimize trips outside their homes. “When you go to the grocery store, please don’t take your family,” he said.  Hawaii Honolulu: Gov. David Ige further tightened travel restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus Monday by ordering people moving between islands to adhere to a 14-day self-quarantine. The order, which takes effect at midnight Wednesday, won’t apply to essential workers like health care workers traveling to other islands. The order comes a week after Ige ordered people arriving from other states or overseas to follow the same two-week quarantine. He’s also ordered all residents to stay at home for the next month. Earlier, a University of Hawaii economist told lawmakers the coronavirus pandemic has plunged the state’s economy into a recession that’s unprecedented for people alive in Hawaii today. “We know Hawaii is already in a deep recession. That recession will surpass anything we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” Carl Bonham told members of a House committee on the economic and financial effects of the virus.  Idaho Boise: Gov. Brad Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said Monday that the state primary will be held May 19 as planned, but it will be conducted by mail with no in-person voting due to the coronavirus. The Republican governor is urging all Idahoans eligible to vote to request an absentee ballot. “While the coronavirus situation may change how we practice our right to vote in this primary election, it is important to keep our election dates in place,” Little said in a statement. Officials said the change is necessary because there won’t be enough polling places or workers for people to vote in person. Denney, in a letter to Little on Friday, said officials at many of the facilities used for the 900 polling places told county clerks the facilities may not be available. Denney also said polling place workers have concerns for their health and the health of voters. He said his office’s website has been changed to allow voters to register and request an absentee ballot.  Illinois Chicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday that the city is renting nearly 300 hotel rooms for first responders working during the coronavirus outbreak and worried that returning home between shifts puts their family members at risk. Lightfoot said the city will foot the costs for first responders including Chicago’s police, firefighters or paramedics who want to use the downtown hotel rooms rather than returning to their own homes. She said the city is making arrangements for health care workers with the same concerns about spreading the virus to their families. Lightfoot again said Tuesday that the city expects to see the outbreak peak here in the coming weeks. “There’s no sugarcoating this,” she said. “The numbers are going to get worse before they get better. ” Chicago previously reserved more than 2,000 downtown hotel rooms for people who needed a place to isolate or quarantine away from home as they recover from mild cases of COVID-19.  Indiana Indianapolis: Fourteen more people have died from coronavirus-related illnesses, increasing the state’s virus death toll to 49 as its confirmed cases surged past 2,000, health officials said Tuesday. Indiana’s number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, grew by 374, to 2,159, following corrections to the previous day’s total, the Indiana State Department of Health said. A week ago, the state had 365 confirmed cases and 12 reported deaths from COVID-19. Five of the state’s 14 new deaths involved Indianapolis residents, and four others were from Lake County. There was one death each reported from Elkhart, Decatur, Hancock, Ripley and Warren counties. Tuesday’s update on the pandemic in Indiana followed Monday’s announcement by state officials that Indiana hospitals have increased the state’s intensive care unit capacity by about one-third in the past few weeks in preparation for an expected surge in coronavirus-related illnesses.  Iowa Des Moines: A judge has set a hearing for Wednesday to consider whether to block an order by Gov. Kim Reynolds that temporarily halted abortions in the state. State district court Judge Andrew Chappell signed an order Monday setting the telephone hearing to consider arguments by abortion providers and the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. They say Reynolds is violating the state constitution by including abortion in an order she enacted Friday to halt all elective and non-emergency medical procedures. Reynolds will be represented by the Iowa attorney general’s office. Reynolds, a Republican, said the move was to preserve medical equipment during the coronavirus pandemic emergency and denied it was based on her opposition to abortion rights. ACLU of Iowa lawyer Rita Bettis Austen said in court filings that up to 30 women who were scheduled for abortion procedures this week could be forced to have babies against their will.  Kansas Wichita: A local official wants to temporarily close an abortion clinic to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has sickened residents and staff at another nursing home. Sedgwick County Commissioner Michael O’Donnell said Monday that he’ll ask the commission to strip abortion clinics from the list of “essential” businesses that can stay open during the pandemic, thus shuttering the Trust Women Wichita Clinic, The Wichita Eagle reports. Julie Burkhart, founder and CEO of the clinic, called the proposal “unethical” and “unconscionable. ” The clinic replaced the practice of late-term abortion provider Dr. George Tiller, who was fatally shot by an anti-abortion activist in 2009. “This is nothing more than a political tool they are using in order to shut down abortion,” Burkhart said. O’Donnell presented the proposal even as federal judges temporarily blocked similar efforts in other states.  Kentucky Frankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signed legislation Monday offering relief to workers and employers suffering economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The bill was put on the fast track by lawmakers last week as the Bluegrass State deals with rising numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths linked to the illness. The Democratic governor thanked the Republican-led Legislature for its quick action. The legislation reinforces many of the emergency actions already taken by his administration, Beshear said. Businesses statewide have closed or scaled back operations. The virus-relief bill has several layers but includes putting relaxed access to unemployment insurance into law. It waives the seven-day waiting period for Kentucky residents to access jobless benefits. It also extends benefits to the self-employed and others normally ineligible for assistance. And it allows workers cut back to part-time status to draw a partial benefit.  Louisiana Baton Rouge: State lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Tuesday for a short introduction of last-minute bills, including emergency measures aimed at the coronavirus pandemic, as the House was rattled with news that one of its younger members was hospitalized with the COVID-19 disease. Rep. Ted James, a Baton Rouge Democrat who chairs the House criminal justice committee, announced late Monday that he was in the hospital with pneumonia stemming from the virus. The news was particularly jarring because James is only 37 years old. “I hope my constituents and the people of Louisiana look at my experience and understand that this virus does not know age, race, health or socioeconomic status,” James said in a statement. “I implore everyone to stay home, stay safe and save lives. I know God is in control, and I look forward to beating this and returning to work soon. ” Maine Scarborough: The state now has more than 300 people testing positive for the new coronavirus – and two more deaths, the Maine Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday. Those two deaths linked to COVID-19, one each in York and Kennebec counties, bring the total to five in Maine, according to the Maine CDC. Nearly 60 people are hospitalized, the agency said. Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories will begin production Wednesday of COVID-19 tests, making 50,000 of them daily at its manufacturing plant outside Portland, company officials said. The Scarborough plant expects to produce more than 1 million tests per month that can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, said Kimberly LaFleur, a company spokeswoman. Maine, which has experienced testing shortages, is “very interested” in the system, but more information is needed, said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC.  Maryland Annapolis: A public-private initiative will provide $4 million to a Johns Hopkins University-led team to study therapeutic uses of blood plasma recovered from COVID-19 patients, according to an announcement from Bloomberg Philanthropies, Gov. Larry Hogan and Johns Hopkins University. Arturo Casadevall, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins, is leading the effort. In recent weeks, he has led a team from around the nation to create a network of hospitals and blood banks that can start collecting and processing the plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Researchers hope to use the technique to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients. They also hope to use it to boost the immune systems of health care providers and first responders. Currently, there are no proven drug therapies or effective vaccines for treating COVID-19. The funding consists of a $3 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies and $1 million from the state of Maryland, according to a news release from the governor’s office.  Massachusetts Boston: The administrator of a veterans home where 11 residents died recently mismanaged an outbreak of the new coronavirus, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse said Tuesday. The Democrat said the first deaths occurred last Wednesday, but officials at the Holyoke Soldiers Home failed to disclose the deaths until Sunday. Morse said he’d called Bennett Walsh, the facility’s then-superintendent, directly after receiving an anonymous complaint. “I was incredibly disappointed,” Morse said. “There was a clear lack of urgency, and we were repeatedly told that these were folks with underlying health conditions. That’s certainly not an excuse for not isolating the folks that did test positive. ” The mayor also said he was concerned about the lack of urgency from state Secretary of Veterans’ Services Francisco Urena, who Morse said also joined in Sunday’s call at one point.  Michigan Detroit: Hundreds of new health care graduates from Michigan State University are available to respond to the coronavirus outbreak, the school said Tuesday. State officials have made a desperate plea for health professionals as the number of cases rises each day. MSU said the state has created a temporary license for nurses who are typically required to first take a national exam. Doctors from the colleges of Human Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine also can work ahead of their medical residencies, which start in July, MSU said. “Adding more than 350 medical professionals to the health care workforce at this critical juncture will make a substantive difference in combating this virus,” said Dr. Norman Beauchamp Jr. , executive vice president for health sciences. The state’s medical executive, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, said Michigan needs nurses and acute-care doctors.  Minnesota St. Paul: Advocates for the homeless are taking steps to protect the vulnerable population from contracting the coronavirus, but they say it’s not easy given the busy shelters where people often sleep and eat in close proximity and share restrooms. Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless executive director Rhonda Otteson said many homeless have chronic health conditions, putting them at “grave risk” if they contract COVID-19. “In a time when we are supposed to be social distancing to protect our neighbors and so we don’t overwhelm the limited capacity of the health care system, we have thousands of people in Minnesota living in spaces that were not designed for social distancing,” Otteson said. Hennepin County is moving medically at-risk people from homeless shelters to hotels, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Ramsey County is opening Mary Hall in St. Paul as a respite for homeless adults with coronavirus symptoms. In Rochester, Olmsted County and Catholic Charities of Southern Minnesota are using the Mayo Civic Center Exhibition Hall as a temporary day center and night shelter.  Mississippi Jackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Tuesday issued his first stay-at-home order to try to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, but it is only for one of the 82 counties. Reeves said Lauderdale County, which borders Alabama, has seen a recent rapid increase in positive tests for the highly contagious virus. His order for Lauderdale County began at 10 p. m. Tuesday and lasts for two weeks. Reeves and the state epidemiologist, Dr. Paul Byers, said a nursing home there is considered a hot spot for the virus. They would not release the name of the nursing home but said employees, residents, families and others who have been in contact with the home have been notified. Reeves said he could issue more stay-at-home orders for other parts of Mississippi if test results show other hot spots developing. “There are those who believe that government ought to take over and run everything,” said Reeves, a Republican. “There are those of us who are going to take a data-driven approach. ” Missouri Kansas City: With confirmed coronavirus cases in the state now topping 1,000, civil rights organizations, doctors and others are calling for the release of as many pretrial detainees as possible during the pandemic. The Missouri Supreme Court on Monday made it clear that rules related to the release of detainees leave those decisions to local judges. Last week, a coalition of more than 30 organizations and medical professions urged the Supreme Court to order the release of county jail detainees awaiting trial for nonviolent crimes and those in high-risk categories based on their age or medical condition. Missouri’s two urban areas already have released dozens of inmates. The Missouri Sheriff’s Association said it opposed the “sweeping release of offenders,” citing a variety of concerns, including the safety of victims and the possibility that suspects could commit new crimes while out of jail.  Montana Helena: The governor has asked tourists to stop coming to the state while residents are under a stay-at-home directive to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Gov. Steve Bullock’s directive asking people not to visit Montana for non-work-related purposes also told people to self-quarantine for 14 days if they are coming from another state or country. “While we love our visitors, we would ask that you not come visit while Montanans are watching out for one another by staying at home,” Gov. Steve Bullock said in a statement Monday, saying it is needed to protect the health care system, as well. In a governors’ call with President Donald Trump on Monday, Bullock said Montana does not have enough testing supplies to adequately identify and isolate people who are infected and test people who have been in contact with them. He also said Montana had put in supply orders several times only to have them be canceled because the federal government is requesting the same supplies.  Nebraska Lincoln: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced cancellation of May graduation ceremonies at the state’s four University of Nebraska system campuses, officials said. The Lincoln campus intends to hold an online event, and the May graduates have been invited to attend August, December, May 2021 ceremonies or other future commencements. University of Nebraska at Omaha graduates will be recognized through an online streaming commencement May 8. The grads will be able to take part in a commencement ceremony at Baxter Arena in Omaha in December. The Kearney campus plans to combine commencements for spring and summer graduates July 31. The University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha plans to hold virtual ceremonies May 7 and 9. The grads will have chances to participate in the December ceremony or any future ceremony.  Nevada Las Vegas: Homeless people in the city have been directed to sleep in rectangles painted on the pavement in a makeshift parking lot camp as a way to limit the spread of the coronavirus, a move stirring outrage among some on social media. Former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro suggested in a post on Twitter that the city’s homeless should be temporarily placed in empty hotel rooms. The white-lined patches of pavement were created by officials in the city known for its hospitality after a homeless shelter closed when a man staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. City officials said they decided to temporarily place the homeless in a parking lot of a multi-use facility rather than inside buildings that include a stadium, a theater, exhibit space and meeting rooms because officials planned to reserve them for potential hospital overflow space if needed. City spokesman Jace Radke said Tuesday that the open-air shelter was an “emergency situation” and that the lot was chosen because the city already owned the property.  New Hampshire Enfield: The traditional egg hunts that take place around Easter won’t be held because of the COVID-19 outbreak, but some residents have organized a hunt that incorporates social distancing from now until the April 12 holiday. Residents in five New Hampshire towns are being encouraged to make eggs, said Kate Plumley Stewart, of Enfield. These eggs are not for the taking, though. Residents are encouraged to create their own eggs and leave them outside their home, on a front door or in a window where they can be viewed and enjoyed from the road for an “I Spy”-type of game. The hunt is being organized in Enfield, Canaan, Grafton, Dorchester and Orange.  New Jersey Trenton: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus approached 300 on Tuesday, Gov. Phil Murphy said, just a day after the tally reached about 200. The number of positive cases is near 19,000, up from about 16,000, while the death toll climbed from 198 to 267 overnight, Murphy said during a daily news conference. Among the dead were a 33-year-old firefighter from Passaic and a 30-year-old baseball coach from Cliffside Park. The death toll is a reminder that the best thing residents can do is to continue to avoid social interactions, Murphy said. “I cannot be any clearer in my call: Stay at home before this hits home. Please do your part to flatten this curve,” the Democrat said. The state also received more protective gear from the federal government, and more counties are opening testing centers, according to the governor.  New Mexico Santa Fe: Local elections officials petitioned the state Supreme Court for permission to conduct the June 2 primary election by mail, asserting that the coronavirus pandemic makes it impossible to conduct traditional election-day balloting. Nearly all of the state’s 33 county clerks signed a petition that calls for mail-in ballots to be distributed to registered voters throughout the state. For voters who require assistance with mail-in or provisional ballots, the clerks suggested limited in-person help at service centers. “The 568 election-day polling places … should be ordered not to operate in the 2020 primary election,” the petition says. The request notes that there are no emergency alternatives outlined in state statute that would safeguard polling workers and voters and that a special session of the Legislature to change election procedures is impractical because of the contagion.  New York New York: More than 300 New Yorkers died from the coronavirus in a 24-hour period, a somber-sounding Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday as temporary hospital beds were made available to help relieve the stress on city hospitals inundated with virus patients. City officials announced Tuesday that 250 more ambulances and 500 paramedics and EMTs are headed to New York to help manage record numbers of calls for assistance. Deaths from the coronavirus in the state had topped 1,500 by Tuesday, according to Cuomo. The outbreak hit close to home for the governor, who spoke of his brother and “best friend,” CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, testing positive for the disease. “Luckily we caught it early enough. But it’s my family; it’s your family; it’s all of our families,” the governor said. New York City’s Health Department also recorded the city’s first death of a person under 18 years old.  North Carolina Carrboro: Restaurants and farmers in this town known for arts and cuisine are joining forces to offer residents safe and healthy dishes while also supporting food service jobs threatened by COVID-19. Carrboro United sprouted in the town of 20,000 when a retired retail CEO and a longtime restaurateur came up with selling prepared and raw food packages online to residents, who then line up in cars at a central location to receive their boxes while still practicing social distancing. Packages equivalent to about 1,000 meals were distributed at the first pickup March 21 in the town about 30 miles northwest of Raleigh. Carrboro United said 3,800 such meals were being sold Tuesday, one of three pickup days per week. “It’s very impressive, the community support,” said Justin Platt, a food hub worker. “I’m thanking them. The community is trying to pull together. ” Platt was among 44 employees at Acme Food & Beverage laid off last month following a statewide order to close restaurants for dine-in services, leaving only eight workers employed.  North Dakota Bismarck: Several groups urged Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday to block evictions and foreclosures to protect those suffering economic hardship caused by COVID-19. The request from groups that include the North Dakota Farmers Union and the American Civil Liberties Union came as the state reported its second and third deaths from complications of the coronavirus and as the number of cases surpassed 100. Janna Farley, a spokeswoman for the ACLU’s North Dakota chapter, said the groups, which also include the union representing state employees and teachers, want the Republican governor to issue an order similar to one in neighboring Minnesota that forbid landlords to evict people right now. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor was aware of the push by the groups but had not made a decision on whether to temporarily block evictions and foreclosures. “We’ll address it,” Nowatzki said.  Ohio Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine ordered mandatory weekly online reporting of ventilator availability, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency ordered water systems to reconnect customers disconnected as of Jan. 1. DeWine mandated the reporting on ventilator manufacturing, distribution, retail supplies and overall availability in case the state needs to move supplies around quickly. The Columbus mayor, the local homeless board and the YMCA plan to open a shelter to house homeless people who have COVID-19 but don’t require hospitalization. Nearly 2,200 cases are confirmed in the state, with 55 deaths as of Tuesday and nearly 600 people hospitalized, officials reported. That doesn’t reflect all cases in Ohio because the state limits testing to those who are hospitalized and to health care workers.  Oklahoma Oklahoma City: The state’s total coronavirus cases surpassed 500 on Tuesday, with 84 new confirmations and six more deaths, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department said there are at least 565 cases in 47 of the state’s 77 counties, up from 481 on Monday. The number of COVID-19 deaths rose from 17 to 23. Four deaths were men 65 or older, plus one man and one woman, both 50-64 years old. The increase came a day after University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Chief of Infectious Diseases Dr. Douglas Drevets estimated the state has identified about 10% of all cases. “There are studies from China suggesting that they only identified 15% of all the cases … and that was using more widespread testing than we have here in Oklahoma,” Drevets said. “I am guessing that we are identifying 1 out of every 10. ” Oregon Salem: Facing an expected closure through the end of the academic year, schools across the state have been told to begin distance learning April 13. Some schools are already handing out smart tablets and Wi-Fi devices to students. Gov. Kate Brown closed schools through April 28, but because the coronavirus pandemic has not reached its peak in the United States, that closure is expected to be extended. In Crook County, a high-desert region in Central Oregon, the school district is launching distance learning Wednesday. Assistant Superintendent Joel Hoff said Google Classroom will be used for the vast majority of classes. In one fairly affluent Portland-area school district, an elementary school is handing out iPads to younger students and Chromebooks to students in the third grade and up, as well as Wi-Fi hot spots. The Lake Oswego School District already had an iPad and/or Chromebook for each student that they used in class.  Pennsylvania Harrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf added seven more counties Tuesday to his order to stay at home as the new virus expanded its reach and the state reported another big jump in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Wolf told residents of Lebanon, Franklin, Somerset, Lawrence, Cameron, Crawford and Forest counties to stay home at least through April 30, bringing to 33 the number of counties under the governor’s order. Nearly 11 million Pennsylvania residents, or 85% of the state’s population, have now been instructed to remain in their homes, with exceptions that include working at a business that’s still open, going to the grocery store or pharmacy, visiting a doctor, caring for a relative or heading outside to exercise. One day after President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in Pennsylvania, the state’s emergency management agency said it would begin contacting potential applicants, which include state, county and municipal governments and eligible nonprofits.  Rhode Island Providence: The state’s schoolchildren will continue distance learning through at least the end of April as the state grapples with the growing coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Monday. Although online attendance rates have been higher than anticipated since the state’s public schools moved to remote learning last month, more needs to be done, the Democrat said. To help, the state’s top four cellphone providers have agreed to provide free cellphone hot spot service until May 8, she said. In addition, internet provider Cox will provide two free months of internet service for eligible low-income families. “I am not throwing in the towel and giving up on 142,000 kids,” Raimondo said.  South Carolina Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has ordered the closure of nonessential businesses in the state, his latest in a stair-step escalation of measures aimed at quelling the new coronavirus outbreak. The order, announced by the governor during a news conference Tuesday, took effect Wednesday and applies to thousands of businesses across the state, from tattoo parlors and hair salons to spas, nightclubs, theaters and museums. Not included are grocery stores and pharmacies, as well as gas stations, banks and large-scale retailers like Walmart. “We must do everything we can to stop the spread, be as aggressive as we can be, using the facts, but at the same time, not going too far, destroying business and jobs that people are depending on,” McMaster said on why some businesses were being ordered to close and not others. The state’s two largest cities had enacted similar orders last week, but McMaster, a Republican, had previously shied away from issuing such a mandate for the entire state.  South Dakota Sioux Falls: Mayors from the state’s largest cities told lawmakers Monday that Gov. Kristi Noem’s resistance to ordering a statewide business shutdown has left them struggling to take action to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Legislators convened through a conference call to consider a series of emergency bills, hearing from mayors on a measure that would allow cities and counties to declare a public health emergency and move quickly to shut down businesses. As the governor’s staff explained the bills, Noem’s strategy for the coronavirus crisis became more clear: Try to keep businesses open, and only step in if things get so bad that the state Secretary of Health needs to declare a public health emergency. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken told legislators he has had mayors across the state reach out to him to ask what they should do. He said mayors have been “hamstrung” by the lack of action from Noem. Some cities have not waited for permission, instead closing bars, restaurants and retail stores.  Tennessee Nashville: Gov. Bill Lee says “legal challenges” are preventing the state’s top health officials from releasing location information on where coronavirus deaths have occurred in the state. The Republican is facing increased pressure to release the county information as Tennessee’s death toll from the virus climbed to 23 as of Tuesday – which includes a former college president who was serving as a pastor in Memphis. Lee has stopped short of divulging specifics around those legal challenges, however, when pressed as to why his administration was refusing to release the information that is currently being distributed in many other states. Instead, Lee said his office was studying the situation and hinted the position may change in the near future. “There’s a unique and challenging legal issue around reporting deaths by county, but we want to get past that issue if at all possible,” Lee said during a Monday news briefing.  Texas Dallas: A federal judge has blocked the city from enforcing an ordinance requiring private businesses to offer paid sick leave, but activists contend employees need those benefits more than ever as the coronavirus continues to spread. District Judge Sean Jordan on Monday granted a preliminary injunction, ruling that a Texas statute prevents cities from enacting their own paid sick leave orders. The ordinance, approved by the City Council in April 2019, went into effect that August but wasn’t set to be enforced with penalties until April 1. “Whether or not paid sick leave requirements should be imposed by government on private employers is an important public policy issue, made even more significant under the challenging circumstances faced by our nation at this moment,” Jordan wrote. The ordinance mandated that Dallas employers must grant one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked by a staffer.  Utah Salt Lake City: A state medical association has rescinded a recommendation it made last week on behalf of state health officials for doctors to treat coronavirus patients using malaria drugs that medical professionals across the country have cautioned against using until more testing is done. The about-face by the Utah Medical Association came after a group of infectious disease doctors pushed back over the weekend against the Friday guidance. The association said in the first email sent Friday that chloroquine and a similar drug, hydroxychloroquine, had shown “promising data for affecting the course of COVID-19” and that their recommended use was being made at the suggestion of the Utah Department of Health. The association also recommended combining them with zinc. The association reversed positions in a follow-up email Sunday in which it said the Utah Department of Health had withdrawn the previous guidance after “much collaborative discussion” and based on “a lack of convincing evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of off-label use of hydroxychloroquine. ” Vermont Montpelier: The state is making temporary changes to its election laws amid the coronavirus outbreak, Secretary of State Jim Condos said. Candidates will no longer have to gather petition signatures for the state’s primary elections in August and the general election in November, Condos said Monday in a statement. But candidates will still have to file financial disclosure statements, he said. “Eliminating the requirement for candidates to collect signatures for petitions is necessary in this time when we are sheltering at home, avoiding gatherings, and avoiding unnecessary contact with other people,” Elections Director Will Senning said. The state had 293 cases and another death from COVID-19, bringing the total number of deaths to 13, according to the Vermont Department of Health.  Virginia Richmond: Gov. Ralph Northam on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order along with a lecture for those who packed the state’s beaches last weekend or otherwise ignored calls to avoid mass gatherings. “You are being very, very selfish because you are putting all of us, especially our health care providers, at risk,” Northam, who is also a doctor, said at a news conference. “To date, this has been a suggestion to Virginians. Today, it’s an order. ” Northam’s executive order tells the state’s approximately 8. 5 million people they must stay home except for limited circumstances, such as traveling to or from work, seeking medical attention, obtaining goods and services, or engaging in outdoor activity. The order also adds restrictions to the state’s public beaches, closing them to sunbathing but permitting exercising and fishing. Those who violate the order could be subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties.  Washington Seattle: Public health officials and researchers said Monday that social distancing appears to be helping slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Seattle area, where many of the first U. S. deaths occurred, but Gov. Jay Inslee says the public still needs to be prepared for the state’s current two-week stay-at-home order to be extended. Dr. Jeff Duchin, the public health officer for Seattle and King County, said a new analysis by the Bellevue-based Institute of Disease Modeling provides a powerful indication that the region needs to double-down on the policies it’s already adopted. “What we’re doing now appears to be working,” Duchin said. “We need to continue this for weeks. ” Inslee said that while no final decision has been made on extending the order, “it is very highly likely that there will be some further measures. ” West Virginia Williamson: The only hospital in a southern West Virginia county is closing after the coronavirus crisis disrupted attempts to sell the business, news outlets report. Williamson Memorial Hospital in Mingo County announced plans Monday to close in three weeks. In a statement, hospital officials explained that they went into bankruptcy proceedings in February and obtained a loan to fund operations until the business could be sold. The idea was to stay open until a sale closed in early April. But all potential buyers were health care providers who are now focused on preparing their own facilities for waves of coronavirus patients, delaying any sale. U. S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va. , called it “unconscionable” that any hospital would close while the virus spreads. “I will continue to work with hospital leadership and state and local officials on next steps to ensure that Mingo County will not go without treatment during this terrible pandemic,” he said.  Wisconsin Milwaukee: The coronavirus has delivered a severe blow to dairy farmers who rely on selling milk to restaurants, schools and the hospitality industry. About one-third of Wisconsin dairy products, mainly cheese, are sold in the food service trade. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring, right when we need money to buy supplies for the spring planting season,” said dairy farmer John Rettler of Neosho, president of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison. Dairy farmers are concerned about processing plants shuttering or slashing production because their product is perishable. Baraboo cooperative Foremost Farms recently asked its members in a letter to brace for scenarios that may include dumping milk or scaling down the amount they produce, noting “the extreme nature of the coronavirus situation and the impact on the economy. ” Wyoming Cheyenne: The state has no plans for a stay-at-home order to contain the coronavirus, but any order for the entire state would contain no exemptions, Gov. Mark Gordon said Monday. Gordon made the remarks as confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus in Wyoming approached 100 and two days after the Jackson Town Council approved a stay-at-home order for the resort town of 10,000 near Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The local order – the first for any area within Wyoming since the pandemic began – contains a number exemptions including for domestic violence victims seeking safe haven, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “If we’re going to issue a shelter in place or stay at home order, it will not have multiple exemptions. It will be a true stay-at-home order,” Gordon said at a news conference.
